<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The object the writer has in view in
this Publication is to place on record
the remarkable discoveries made in
a department of Archæology hitherto
almost unnoticed in Ireland, except in
the Proceedings, Catalogues, and Journals of various
learned Societies. So far back as 1861 a writer remarked
that such a work would be “a real boon to
archæology,” yet in the interval none has appeared.
The cause is not far to seek. A publication treating of
the habits and social economy of long-forgotten generations
is little calculated to gain a rapid foothold with
the general public, by whom the study of the past may
probably be considered dull as well as useless reading.
To many, however, it proves most interesting to observe&mdash;despite
widest variations of climatic conditions&mdash;the
great similarity of the ways and habits of man while
in a rude uncultivated state&mdash;acting as it were by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
common instinct&mdash;and again to trace his upward progress
towards civilization. A wide tract in this field
of archæological research is fortunately opened up by
a comparison of the Irish Lake Dwellings and their
“finds” with those of other countries, more especially
with the discoveries brought into such prominent notice
by Keller in Switzerland, and Munro in Scotland.</p>

<p>To the late Sir William Wilde belongs the honour
of first drawing general attention to the water habitations
of Erin; his labours have been ably followed up
by W. F. Wakeman, who has so largely contributed to
the <i>Journal of the Royal Historical and Archæological Association
of Ireland</i> both Papers and Drawings illustrative
of the subject. In the present work, Kinahan, Reeves,
Graves, Wilde, and other specialists, have been freely
quoted, as evidenced in the text; in short, the observations
of every author have been utilized, provided they
touched on points that could tend in any degree to
elucidate the subject under consideration. “A dwarf
on a giant’s shoulders sees further of the two”: thus
the writer, standing in this line of investigation on the
eminence created by his predecessors, may perhaps be
enabled to lay before his readers a distinct and comprehensive
view of the Ancient Lake Dwellings in Ireland.
Recent discoveries and new matter will be found
in these pages; but the special intention has been to
collect carefully all the information hitherto furnished
by the explorers of Irish Lake Dwellings, and to present
that information in a condensed form, “an abridgment
of all that is pleasant,” so as to render it acceptable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
archæologists, and perchance agreeable to the general
reader, who, not having had his attention previously
directed towards the subject, can scarcely be supposed
willing to explore the voluminous records of scientific
societies in search of items connected with the question
of lacustrine remains in Ireland.</p>

<p>This Publication may, perhaps, help to diffuse more
generally the knowledge already possessed, so that when
fresh discoveries are made in any new locality increased
care may be devoted to the exploration; for every artificial
island is not necessarily of remote antiquity, and
the most careful examination is essential before arriving
at a decision respecting the probable period of the
primary construction of a crannog. It would be fortunate
indeed should these pages excite sufficient attention
to prove, even remotely, the cause of having the
various relics indicative of the social economy and industries
of the inhabitants of our ancient “water-towns”
arranged systematically in the new Museum of the
Science and Art Department, now in course of construction
in Dublin. The facility thus afforded of
studying these antiquities&mdash;some of them safely protected
during untold centuries by their covering of peat
and water&mdash;could not fail to lead to a clearer comprehension
of the real condition of ancient culture and
civilization in Erin.</p>

<p>The Council of the Royal Irish Academy most generously
permitted for this work the use of all the woodcuts
in their possession illustrative of lacustrine remains,
and the same favour was accorded by the Royal Historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
and Archæological Association of Ireland, through
the Secretary, the Rev. James Graves.</p>

<p><a href="#plate08">Plate <span class="smcapuc">VIII.</span></a> and figures <a href="#fig018">18</a>, <a href="#fig027">27</a>,

figures <a href="#fig206">206</a> and <a href="#fig207">207</a> by the Society of Antiquaries of
London, together with <a href="#plate03">plate <span class="smcapuc">III.</span></a> taken from <i>The
Archæologia</i>; figures <a href="#fig006">6</a>, <a href="#fig007">7</a>, and <a href="#fig008">8</a>, by the Anthropological
Society; figures <a href="#fig214">214</a> and <a href="#fig215">215</a> by the well-known antiquary,
John Evans; <a href="#plate38">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXVIII.</span></a>, by W. T. Lockwood;
and by permission of Robert Mac Adam figures <a href="#fig126">126</a>,
<a href="#fig147">147</a>, and <a href="#fig148">148</a>, are reproduced from the <i>Ulster Journal of
Archæology</i>. As far as practicable, every hitherto published
illustration bearing on the subject was applied
for, and, with but one exception, most kindly granted.</p>

<p>Much valuable information was furnished by W. F.
Wakeman, who has also drawn most of the illustrations,
their character and expression being well carried out by
the engraver, William Oldham.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Let us travel back in thought some thousands
of years, and picture to ourselves the aspect
of Erin at that period. After all, this retrospect
is comparatively short, if we take as
correct the present computed period of man’s
existence on this globe. Geology now assigns
to the human race a duration it was long
considered heterodox to imagine: generation
upon generation, who shall say how many,
lie beneath the sod over which our footsteps now pass.</p>

<p>The words of Genesis are in no way antagonistic to the discoveries
of modern geologists, nor even to the theory of evolution.
That the term “day,” as used in the Book of Genesis, is not to be
understood as confined to a mere duration of twenty-four hours,
but should be taken as an undefined period of time, is a point
now so generally admitted that it is scarcely needful to quote
the words of Scripture, that “one day is with the Lord as a
thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.” In common
parlance we speak of events that occurred “in days of
old” without intention to limit the idea to periods of twenty-four
hours: the form of expression may be held to cover an
indefinite number of centuries. In the modern acceptation of
the word used to denote the duration of twenty-four hours, we
consider the day to be represented by the morning and the
evening: there is the brightness of morn followed by the gloom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of eve. How different is the idea conveyed by the words of
Moses, who was versed in all the learning of the Egyptians,
“the Evening and the Morning were the first day,” and so on
to the end of the six days or intervals of time. While in its
course through the heavens our planet was in process of solidifying,
“the earth was without form and void, and darkness
was upon the face of the deep.” Here we have the evening:
afterwards “there was light,” that is to say, morning followed,
marking full completion of the first day, or interval of time in
the earth’s progress towards its present state. It is therefore
plain that the term evening cannot be considered to represent a
decline from the state of the previous period; rather it betokens
the nature of the morn about to follow. We watch with interest
the signs of the evening, not in relation to the day which has
already passed away, but as foreshowing the kind of morn that is
to succeed.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In looking back through the pages of history we arrive at a
period when all written records cease; but the remains of the
dwellings of man, of his arts and industries, enable us to trace
out in some degree the general routine of his every-day life.
In the matter now under consideration, prehistoric archæology
interests chiefly as demonstrating, in a practical manner, the state
of the people who occupied Erin long before the beginning of
authentic history. Recent researches enable us to lift the veil that
heretofore concealed the past of subsided lake-dwellings in Ireland,
to bid</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Forgotten generations live again,</div>
<div class="verse">Assume the bodily shapes they wore of old”;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">to realize to a great extent the physical past of their inhabitants,
and in imagination to partake of their daily life. If till lately the
learned were on this subject purblind, it is the less surprising that
the uncultured fisherman, gliding in his skiff over the placid surface
of the waters and peering into the clear depths, should have
failed to recognize that the mouldering stems projecting from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
oozy bottom were traces of the love of security of his forefathers,
that in the muddy matrix of the ever-accumulating lacustrine
deposit, are preserved material evidence of a state of society long
since passed away.</p>

<p>Until the first half of this nineteenth century all memory of
the ancient lake-dwellers of Ireland seemed to have vanished completely,
but with the study of ethnology the interest excited in
tracing out the idiosyncrasies of the various races of man penetrated
to Ireland also, and now “few things can be more interesting
than the spectacle of an ancient, long-forgotten people, thus
rising, as it were, from the waters of oblivion to take that place
which properly belongs to it in the history of the human race.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Beyond the limits of history and archæology there extends a
boundless period of human existence. Far back in this indefinite
past we catch glimpses of a shadowy race, the first dwellers in
Erin, who, it may be fairly surmised, were in a very rude state&mdash;nomad
hunters and fishers, subsisting by the chase, which they
supplemented by indigenous wild fruits:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Rugged type of primal man,</div>
<div class="verse">Grim utilitarian,</div>
<div class="verse">Loving woods for hunt and prowl,</div>
<div class="verse">Lake and hill for fish and fowl.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They formed their ordinary implements and their weapons of
warfare from flint, stone, bone, shells, and even wood.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“They were, then were not; they have lived and died,</div>
<div class="verse">No trace, no record of their <i>date</i> remaining.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">New comer succeeded new comer in Erin. This epoch was eminently
characterized by the sway of brute force&mdash;a warlike front
alone secured immunity from spoliation; in short, these times were
governed on</p>

<div class="verse">That he should take who has the power,</div>
<div class="verse">And he should keep&mdash;who can.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Wooded nature of the Country.</i>&mdash;The ancient classical name of
Ireland was Ierne, which some etymologists derive through its
Greek form from the Celtic, signifying, they say, “the extremity,”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the “Ultima Thule” of classic writers; a mystic land, girded by
unknown seas, and protected by phantom dangers, the product of
imagination,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The witty and eccentric Dean Swift, remarking on the custom of
writers of his day, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“So geographers in Afric’ maps</div>
<div class="verse">With savage pictures fill their gaps,</div>
<div class="verse">And o’er inhabitable downs</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is strange how long this ignorance both as regards Ireland and
the “Dark Continent” continued. One of the earliest names of
Ireland, given her by her own native poets, is very descriptive,
<i>Fidh-inis</i>, “the woody island.” This name at once brings before
our minds the then characteristic feature of the country, even as
its modern poetical designation, “The Emerald Isle,” depicts the
luxuriant vegetation watered by the cloud-masses of the Atlantic.
The bogs of Ireland, however, speak even more eloquently on this
point than her bards, for in these bogs vestiges of ancient forests
are found buried, sometimes at great depth below the present
surface; the remains of oak, birch, mountain ash, alder, yew,
beech, deal, &amp;c., testify to the variety of the arboreous vegetation:
they lie either prostrate in a horizontal position, or bear marks of
having been felled by man. According to old bardic accounts,
the first proceeding chronicled of the earliest settlers was the
clearing of timber off many great plains in various parts of Ireland,
evidently showing the paucity of arable land.</p>

<p><i>Wild Animals.</i>&mdash;This continuous forest must have swarmed with
wild animals of every description. Wolves, which even in the present
day prove a scourge occasionally in parts of Europe, were
numerous; the caves which abounded in the country were the
home of the bear, and the boar fed beneath the deep forest shade.
In these remote times, too, the Irish elk, with its huge, broad,
branching antlers, a creature of immense size and strength, was
existent. Remains of this gigantic deer, the <i>Megaceros Hibernicus</i>,
have been found, covered by the peat at various depths, sometimes
close to the surface; and from allusions in Irish poetry and legends<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
it is more than probable that it continued to exist down to a much
later period than most of the other animals now extinct. In a very
curious legend, one of the great Irish bards who is reputed to have
lived in the third century, and to have himself attained a very
advanced age, is described as reciting at a banquet a poem in
which he extolled the greatness and strength of his contemporaries
and forefathers, and described the tall gigantic deer hunted by
them. His listeners laughed incredulously, whereat the old man
rose in anger, and going to a neighbouring heap where were piled
the relics of bygone hunts, he selected therefrom a shank-bone, and
returning to the banquet, took from the table one of the shank-bones
of the deer on which the guests were then feasting, and
dropped it through the hollow of the bone he had brought in.
This legend of the dim old times tends to prove that at a very
remote period tradition alone kept up the memory of the Irish
Bighorn.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The fact of the co-existence of the <i>Megaceros</i> with man
does not, however, rest on mere legend; for in a locality called
the “Elk Hole,” Co. Wexford, numerous skeletons of the extinct
deer have been found in company with the remains of man, also a
skull and horns, in the “kitchen midden” of the largest of the
lake dwellings in Loughrea, Co. Galway, measuring over 13 feet
from tip to tip of the antlers;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> whilst in the refuse heap at
Breagho, Co. Fermanagh, portion of an antler (according to the
opinion of Professor Owen) was discovered, sawn and perforated
with holes. It does not necessarily follow that this relic had
belonged to an animal killed and utilized by the lake-dwellers;
the horn may have been found by them on some spot where it
had rested for ages. However, in the lake-dwelling at Cloonfinlough,
Co. Roscommon, bones of the <i>Megaceros Hibernicus</i> have
been dug up in a very broken state, as if fractured for the purpose
of extracting the marrow, whilst remains of the <i>Megaceros</i>, in company
with a greenstone celt, were discovered in a cave at Cappagh,
the bones broken and formed into implements by the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
man.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In Lough Gur, Co. Limerick, wherein is the site of a lake
dwelling, remains of the <i>Cervus tarandus</i>, or reindeer,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> were found,
together with those of the bear; and near Ballybetagh, Co. Dublin,
similar remains were associated with those of the <i>Megaceros</i>, whilst
elsewhere bones of the <i>Cervus alces</i>, or true elk, have been exhumed,
and traces of the mammoth, <i>Elephas primigenius</i>, have been found
near Dungannon.</p>

<p><i>Climatic Changes.</i>&mdash;If reliance can be placed on the accounts of
classical writers, it would appear that two thousand years ago an
excessive degree of cold prevailed in the climate of Europe. The
great number and extent, of forests, lakes, and morasses, which
according to classical authors existed in their time, must have
rendered the climate of Europe exceedingly cold and moist. The
forests have nearly all been felled, the stagnant water drained,
thus producing a very considerable difference between the temperature
described as existing in these latitudes 2000 years ago
and in the present day. What occurred on the Continent occurred
also in Ireland, which, shaded with forests and abounding in
marshes, must have had an atmosphere more frigid than if its soil
were then, as now, freely exposed to solar influence.</p>

<p>Claudian applied to Ireland the epithet ‘icy’: Strabo looked on
it as a country scarcely habitable; Mela described the climate as
cold and unfavourable: however, to counterbalance these authorities,
it may be inferred from Tacitus that Ireland was considered
milder in climate than Gaul; in that point of view Æthicus says it
was superior to Britain, and Solinus states that it abounded in
pastures. Owing to the disappearance of Erin’s former leafy
mantle, and the absence of pestilential exhalations from stagnant
fens, the summers have become much <i>colder</i> and the winters
<i>warmer</i> than in remote times.</p>

<p>The turf-cutter in Ireland finds that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> “usually the roots and
trunks of the trees under the peat, or in the lowest strata, are
principally those of the oak and yew, as if prior to the growth of
the peat the low country was a vast forest of these trees. It would
appear that subsequently mosses and other peat-producing plants
began to grow and flourish, until eventually they stopped the
drainage, and formed an envelope of peat, thus killing the trees,
which one by one toppled over and were buried in the succeeding
growth of peat. After the disappearance of the major portion of
the oak trees, the bogs, year by year, gradually increased in depth,
until apparently suddenly, for some as yet unexplained cause,
their growth ceased, and on their surface forests, principally of
deals, sprang up.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Thus we see that since the glacial period
there have been great changes in the aspect and the surface of
Ireland: first, the great oak forest age; then an age in which
was an active growth of peat; thirdly, a period when forests
of deal sprang up; fourthly, again a period of luxuriant peat
growth.</p>

<p>The remains of human handicraft, in the form of log-houses or
lake-dwellings, have been found buried under each and all these
peat growths: a depth of 25 feet had overgrown the log-house
discovered at Inver, Co. Donegal, and on the floor-level, outside
the building, were traces of the corkers of the great oak forest
age. It is practically impossible to estimate the rate at which a
bog grows: if there be a fall, and consequent drainage, it will
increase but little, whereas an undrained bog augments with
considerable rapidity: so many contingencies are thus introduced
as practically to invalidate in a great degree calculations regarding
the growth of peat over prehistoric or other remains. G. H.
Kinahan has estimated that in undisturbed conditions each year’s
growth, represented by a layer or lamina somewhat resembling
the markings on a forest tree, would average one hundred laminæ
to the foot in white or surface turf, two to three hundred to the
foot in brown turf, and six to eight hundred to the foot in black
turf, so that the accumulation of 25 feet above the log-house at
Inver, according to this painstaking calculation, would represent an
age of startling remoteness.</p>

<p><i>Lakes.</i>&mdash;Ireland was a land of lakes as well as of forests, for
the white-shell marl, which forms the substratum of peat bog
in low-lying situations, was formerly covered by water, till
gradually displaced by the encroachments of the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
bog. Many of the smiling districts of to-day were then covered
by water&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Now land, now lake, and shores with forest crowned.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Lakes were thickly scattered over the face of the country&mdash;lakes
of irregular shape connected by stagnant shallows&mdash;the majority of
small size, half marsh, half water, fringed with forest, and abounding
in fish: The axe of the primitive pioneer and the modern
engineers’ spade have revolutionized the aspect of the landscape:
this process however was gradual, the forests were only driven
back little by little, and it is comparatively yesterday since draining
operations on a large scale have been carried out; within the
memory of persons still living there were numerous localities
throughout the kingdom, where</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The bittern’s lonely boom was heard</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Along the waving reeds.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is only after drainage on a great, or rather thorough scale, that
anything like complete inspection of the original structure of a
lake dwelling, or any extensive “find” can be hoped for, the
majority of such sites being surrounded by soft pulpy bog to such
a depth and extent as to bewilder the most enthusiastic explorer.</p>

<p>Lough or Loch is the term applied both in Ireland and Scotland
to a lake: it also signifies an arm of the sea. The shores of
small sheets of water, and marshes with sedge-grown borders, were
generally surrounded by bog, and the annual growth of this
latter substance gradually encroached on the lake, till its former
shining surface was changed into a peat moss.</p>

<p>It has been remarked, that occasionally the silt now occupying
the former lake-bed, demonstrates the fact, that the under stratum
was formed in great measure by decomposed vegetable matter,
probably aqueous plants and the shed foliage of the encircling
forest: the later deposit is considerably mixed with fine clay.
The most probable solution of this problem is, that on the disappearance
of the woods the exposed surface of the soil was
washed down from the surrounding heights by every shower
that fell, and if the land were tilled this denudation would be
accelerated. Consequent upon the discharge of the water deepening
and extending the outlet, and the contemporaneous deposition of
matter held in solution in the lake-bed, small loughs in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
instances now occupy sites which, from natural evidences, it is
apparent must formerly have been extensive sheets of water;
in other instances the large lake of ancient days, is now represented
by several of diminutive size, connected by marshes that had at
one time formed part of a great whole. In ancient times,
however, the lakes most frequently appear to have gradually
increased in height: this was due to the silting up of the outlet,
under any circumstance a long and tedious process; for though
the aqueous growth on the bottom of the outlet would, during
the summer, impede and catch the heavy particles washed
down or held in solution by the current, yet in winter, when it
decayed, most of the accumulated matter would be swept away, so
that in a hundred years the increase in height of the outlet would
be scarcely perceptible. What then must be the age of lake
dwellings, where three and even four superincumbent floors
testify to the necessity of providing against the ever-rising
water level!</p>

<p>Lakes, marshes, and woods, have in all ages afforded shelter
to the conquered, and have often enabled them to set the invader
at defiance. Pliny describes the Caledonian forests as “Romanorum
armis terminus.” A race inferior in numbers, in arms, or in
physical development, would avail themselves of artificial or natural
bulwarks to ward off the attacks of dreaded enemies, and water
and woods have from the earliest times formed important factors
in the art of defence.</p>

<p>One cause to which may be ascribed the first erection of lake
dwellings in Ireland was the original paucity of open country, for
on the arrival of the first colonists (if credence is to be given to
the early native annals) the only plain not covered with forest was
the level district stretching between Dublin and Howth. This
statement of the superabundance of forest is, to some extent, corroborated
by the vast number of local names derived from Irish
words signifying woods or timber of some description. However,
the most probable cause of their erection was to serve
as places of refuge, for these island homes would necessarily
provide safety and protection; indeed such, in their later or historical
existence, was undoubtedly the cause of their continuous occupation.
It is quite obvious that in primitive times, especially, a
habitation on water was of great security&mdash;more secure than could
be a stockaded <i>doon</i> or fort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Lake dwellings have been universally employed both in ancient
and modern times: similar physical surroundings originated practically
the same style of structures amongst far distant and even
ocean-separated tribes. “Man is moulded to a remarkable degree,
physically as well as mentally, by manner of living, food, and
climate. Among barbarous nations,” says Humboldt, “we find a
<i>tribal</i>, rather than an individual physiognomy; there are no
varieties of intellectual development to stamp the face with
diversity of character: thus the slave-dealers in Upper Egypt
never ask for the individual character of a slave; they only
inquire where he was born, his character being that of his tribe.”</p>

<p>Let us now, like Puck,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Put a girdle round about the earth,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and inspect these habitations for ourselves. Ancient classical writers
are not altogether silent on the subject. Hippocrates, who lived
upwards of 400 years <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, when describing the manner of life of
the inhabitants of Phasis, a region of the Black Sea, says that the
country was fenny and wooded, the climate warm and humid;
but despite these disadvantages, the natives lived entirely in the
swamps, “for their dwellings are constructed of wood and reeds,
and are erected amidst the waters.” He adds that they seldom
practise walking, either in the city or the market, but sail up and
down in canoes constructed out of single trees, for there are many
canals there.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>An account is given by Herodotus of the abode of a Thracian
tribe, the Pæonians, who lived on Lake Prasias, now Lake Takinos,
situated in the country known in the present day as Roumelia.
The habitations of this tribe were reared on platforms, raised on
piles above the water, and connected with the shore by a narrow
causeway of similar formation. This tribe successfully resisted the
attack of a Persian army under the satrap Myabyzus. The Father
of History thus describes this settlement:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>“The habitations on the
lake of Prasias are of this nature&mdash;floors laid on lofty poles stand
in the middle of the lake,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> with a narrow entrance by one bridge
from the mainland. All the inhabitants used to drive, at their
common expense, the piles that served to support the floors. Subsequently
they have adopted the following regulation: for every
woman a man marries he is to drive three piles, which they procure
from a mountain called Orbelus. Now, every man takes
several wives. They dwell here in the following manner: each
has a hut in which he lives, and a trap-door in the floor opening
down to the water. To their horses and draught cattle they
give as fodder fish, of which there is such an abundance that
when one opens his trap-door, and lets down his empty basket
into the lake by a cord, after waiting only a short time, he hauls it
up full of fish.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The fishermen of this lake still continue, as in
the time of Herodotus, to inhabit huts built over the water.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In Layard’s work, descriptive of the discoveries on the site of
Nineveh, there is an engraving of a bas-relief from the palace of
Sennacherib, which represents an artificial island, apparently formed
by weaving together the tall reeds that grew on the banks of the
Euphrates; and a prehistoric age is indicated by the dwellings
which existed in the Gocktscha lake in Armenia.</p>

<p>It is certain that lake dwellings were used as places of permanent
abode. Remains of such works of ancient date are, on the
continent of Europe, by no means confined to the area of Switzerland,
to which country they were for some time popularly supposed
to belong exclusively; they have been found in Savoy, in the north
of Italy, Würtemberg, Bavaria, Austria (Carinthia), Hungary,
Mecklenburg, Denmark, Pomerania, Brandenburg, and also in
France. If dependence can be placed on remains found in these
numerous and widely-distributed sites, many of them would appear
to have been occupied so late as the period of the Romans; and the
silence of their historians on the subject is therefore singular, as in
general the characteristic traits of the tribes with which the Roman
legions came in contact were depicted with remarkable fidelity.</p>

<p>In Switzerland, during the year 1829, an excavation was made
on the shore at Ober Meilen, on the lake of Zurich, for the purpose
of deepening the harbour; and although piles and other antiquities
were then discovered, they appear to have attracted no attention.
So matters stood till the winter of 1853-4, when an extraordinary
drought and long-continued frost caused the lakes to sink to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
level never before known. This circumstance presented great facilities
for the reclamation of land along the shores, and the inhabitants
of Ober Meilen proceeded to rescue from the water some of
the land thus temporarily exposed. When making excavations to
form an embankment, they came upon a net-work of wooden piles,
a great number of stags’ horns, and various implements, only two
of which were of bronze. The discovery of this settlement aroused
peculiar interest, not merely on account of its being apparently the
first recorded, but because it evidently belonged almost exclusively
to the stone age. Similar structures were immediately after discovered
in almost all the lakes of Switzerland, the favourite site
being a sunny sheltered bay, with soft and gently-shelving bottom.
They were of three classes&mdash;first, <i>pile dwellings</i>: the piles, sometimes
30 feet in length, were driven into
the bottom of the lake, and occasionally
further strengthened by the deposit of
stones around their base: these constructions
always occur in deep water. Secondly,
<i>frame pile dwellings</i>, in which the
piles, instead of being driven into the
mud, were fixed by a mortise and tenon
arrangement into split trunks lying horizontally
along the bottom of the lake.
Thirdly, <i>fascine dwellings</i>, formed by layers
of fagots, alternating with brushwood,
clay, gravel, and stones, one over the
other, till the top reached the required
level above the surface of the water; piles were driven in around
to bind the heap together, and the whole overlaid by a wooden
floor, upon which the dwellings were erected.</p>

Swiss Pile Dwelling.</p>
</div>

<p>This construction bears a close family resemblance to the Irish
type, in which the huts stood, so to speak, on <i>terra firma</i>, and not
<i>en l’air</i>, above the surface of the water. Like Irish dwellings of
analogous formation, this species of substructure has as yet been
found only in small lakes with soft and muddy bottoms, and of
little depth and extent; they owe their origin to the fact, that piles
driven into the oozy lake bottom could not have supported the
necessary weight; for, if heavily laden, they must have sunk altogether
below the surface of the water, or at least could not have
retained their relative positions. This formation seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
been of more ancient date than the artificial stages upon piles
alone, inasmuch as few, if any, instances have been discovered in
which bronze remains are associated with fascine dwellings. So far
as can be judged from the manner in which the timbers are mortised
together, as well as from the characteristics of the fictile ware
found, their inhabitants differed in nothing from those who, owing
to their better acquaintance with metal, constructed dwellings of
greater solidity, in deeper water, and under more varied conditions.
“<i>It was impossible to adopt the fascine structure in the larger lakes</i>,
for it must have been foreseen that the waves which could drive
amongst the upright piles of the usual pile dwelling without injuring
them, would, in stormy weather, wash over the edges of the
fascine platform and tear it in pieces.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The “fascine” lake dwelling in the lake of Fuschl, near the
Mondsee in Austria, resembles, in most respects, those found in
Switzerland, Ireland, and Scotland. This little lake is rich in fish,
and its banks abound with game; on its western shore, in a little
inlet, lies an artificial island nearly circular, about fifty paces in
diameter, separated from the mainland by a narrow channel, now
almost choked with peat-moss and marsh plants. The islet is only
just above the ordinary water-level, and on inspection its construction
was found to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, a thick layer of peat-moss, then a stratum of branches,
principally of mountain pine and dwarf birch: the foundation consists
of large boughs or trunks of pine trees, the top pointing inwards.
Small piles were driven through the different layers to hold
the mass together, whilst on the exterior, a number of much smaller
piles were driven into the lake-bed, probably to protect the structure
from wave action. The difference in general constructive
details between the dwellings on Helvetian and Hibernian lakes
may be accounted for by the depth of water of the former, and the
shallow muddy bottoms of the latter. Remains of a dwelling
have been found embedded in the peat-bogs by which the hill of
Chamblon is surrounded. The peat-cutters of Les Uttins, discovered
horizontal beams with mortises, and a wooden roadway
across the marsh leading to the spot. There are two settlements
here, both very ancient: one is situated at a distance of 1850 yards
from the lake, the other at a distance of 2200 yards, in an alluvial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
plain formed since their erection. Dr. Keller also describes ‘steinberge’
or stonehills, <i>i. e.</i> elevations on the bottom of the lakes, composed
of stones and gravel artificially deposited. These were
formed by the natives on natural shallows, for the purpose of
lessening the depth of water. At Nidau, in the lake of Bienne,
there is an artificial island encircled with piles, planks being laid
horizontally at the bottom to retain in place the stones of which it
is composed. At Möringen, in the same lake, there is a structure
of similar type; whilst a large canoe, which had probably been used
at its formation, was found lying at the bottom laden with a cargo
of stones. Structures almost identical with the Irish have been
found in the lakes of Inkwyler, Nussbaumen, and Wauwyl.
The pile dwellings of Switzerland, <i>i. e.</i> those erected in deep
water and in the larger lakes, bear a much closer resemblance
to the description given by Herodotus than to the dwellings
discovered in Ireland and Scotland. The settlement at Morges,
on the Lake of Geneva, was 1200 feet in length by 120 in width,
so that if entirely covered by a platform its area, according to the
computation of M. Troyan, would have been sufficiently ample to
accommodate a population of upwards of 1200 souls. Sometimes, as
at Wangan, the villages were built close to the shore, and seem, as
in Ireland, to have been protected by palisades.</p>

<p>The framework of the huts was probably made of logs and
wattles, or of hurdles plastered over with clay: portions of the latter,
with marks of the wattling still distinct on them, have been drawn
from their watery bed. The Swiss dwellings appear to have been
rectangular, resembling perhaps the châlets of the present day: it
has not been decided whether they were divided into rooms, but,
just as in the Irish dwellings, each hut had its hearth, of which
the flat stones still often lie in <i>situ</i>; the invariable presence of
clay weights indicates that most families possessed a loom, whilst
from the remains of straw and reeds, it may be inferred that the
roofs were thatched. The wide chronological range of these remains
is very remarkable. The settlements in which stone implements
have been found are more widely spread and more numerous
than those of the metallic period. In Switzerland these lake villages
appear to have commenced to decay, or to have been abandoned
towards the close of the bronze age, and to have almost ceased to
exist on the introduction of iron. In the stone era the bones of
wild animals, of stags, of urus, of aurocles, and wild boar, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
found, whilst in the metallic ages remains of domesticated animals
preponderate more and more, till the final abandonment of these
“water-towns.” The remains of human handicraft around the
dwellings illustrate the habits, domestic usages, and skill, of their
inhabitants during untold centuries; but the most striking fact is
not so much their similarity to the Irish structures, as the identity
in form and use of the articles discovered in them, both those
employed in war and in the chase, as also the culinary and domestic
implements, the objects of personal decoration, and those employed
in the toilet.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Scottish archæologists were aroused by the lacustrine discoveries
on the Continent to investigation of similar remains occurring in
their own country. It was found that early historic references to
island forts, and incidental notices of the exposure of artificial
islands, consequent on drainage operations, had been entirely overlooked.
A crannog, that of Lochinadorb, in Moray, was honoured
by a visit from Edward I. in 1303, and was considered of such importance,
that thirty-three years later Edward III. led an army to
its relief. A crannog in Loch Kinord, in Aberdeenshire, is mentioned
in history in the year 1335: it received James IV. as a
guest in 1506, and enjoyed a continuous existence until 1648,
when its fortifications were razed by order of Parliament. Forty
years after the dismantling of this island fortress, the crannog of
Lochan-Eilean, in Strathspey, is described as “useful to the
country in times of trouble or wars, for the people put in their
goods and children here, and it is easily defended.” Artificial
islands formed of wood or stone, often identical with those a
short time previously ascertained to have existed in Ireland,
were found more or less spread over the entire of Scotland. These
have been lately classified and considerably added to by Dr. Munro,
and in his work<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> at least fifty-three well-authenticated discoveries
of wooden lake structures in Scotland are enumerated.</p>

<p>The Dowalton settlement, in the lake of that name, in Wigtownshire,
seems to have been abandoned by its inhabitants at an early
period: nothing mediæval was found on the site; a copper coin
indeed (described, however, as of doubtful character) was picked
up; but as it may have been dropped into the water at any period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
its presence need not disturb such inference as we may draw from
the other articles discovered. Mr. Stuart says, “there is a peculiar
interest in the small colony of Dowalton, from its neighbourhood
to the site of Ptolemy’s Roman town of Leucophibia … and
that at least one object of Roman workmanship … has been
found amongst the relics of the old inhabitants of the islands.
It was only a matter of conjecture how it came there&mdash;whether
in the course of commerce, by gift, or by appropriation after the
removal of their Roman neighbours. It seems, however, not
unreasonable to regard the occurrence of a Roman vessel at
Dowalton, associated as it is with relics which are elsewhere
found in early sepulchral cairns and British hut circles, as pointing
to a period of occupation of the islands not later, and
probably earlier, than that of the Roman settlement.” The list
of antiquities brought to light at Dowalton is therefore extremely
valuable for Irish Archæologists, as it included specimens of almost
everything usually found in Irish crannogs (with the exception
of the copper coin of doubtful character), also of a bronze
vessel of undoubted Roman manufacture.</p>

<p>The Irish lake dwellings have, over and over again, yielded
articles precisely similar to the annexed list,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> but as a rule they
are more prolific in objects of early manufacture, which, from their
style of ornamentation, are commonly referred to a period from
the fifth to the tenth century. Dr. Munro remarks, that although
we cannot “argue definitely from the present geographical distribution
of Scottish lake dwellings, the indications are so clearly
suggestive of their having been peculiar to those districts formerly
occupied by Celtic races, that the significance of this generalization
cannot be overlooked.”</p>

<p>The unlooked-for discovery of lake dwellings in Yorkshire,
resembling those of Ireland and Scotland, proves that in Britain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
also there had been a lacustrine population in times probably prehistoric.
During the execution of drainage operations in the
Holderness district, bone tools and fragments of piles were exhumed:
this led to the discovery of the remains of lake dwellings.
The excavations made it apparent that the construction, as is
observable also in many Irish crannogs, was of two ages&mdash;the
stone and the bronze. In the upper stratum, bronze objects,
then rude stone, flint, and bone weapons. As in the Irish so
in the British remains, the very dressing of the timber framework
demonstrates the fact of the constructors having worked in
the lower portion with stone, and in the upper with metal
hatchets.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that the great city of London seems to
have risen from a collection of rude pile dwellings, as traces of these
structures have been found both near London-Wall and at Southwark.
They are thus described by General Lane-Fox:&mdash;“Upon
looking over the ground, my attention was at once attracted by
a number of piles, the decayed tops of which appeared above the
unexcavated portions of the peat, dotted here and there over the
whole of the space cleared.… Commencing on the south, a row
of them ran north and south on the west side: to the right of these
a curved row, as if forming part of a ring. Higher up, and running
obliquely across the ground, was a row of piles having a
plank about an inch and half thick, and a foot broad, placed along
the south face, as if binding the piles together.… The points of
the piles were inserted from one to two feet in the gravel, and were
for the most part well preserved, but all the tops had rotted off
at about two feet above the gravel, which must have been the
surface of the ground, or of the water at the time these structures
were in existence.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The vast majority of the relics belonged to
the Roman era, but there were others of ruder workmanship. The
kitchen middens contained cockle, mussel, oyster, and periwinkle
shells: amongst the animal remains were those of the red deer,
horse, wild boar, goat, dog, and the <i>Bos-primigenius</i>, <i>Trochoceros</i>,
<i>Longifrons</i>, and <i>Frontosus</i>. The superincumbent strata varied from
18 to 21 feet in depth. The Thames, formerly a less deep but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
wider river than at present, appears to have had a pile-dwelling
population established on its shallows at various favourable points.
At Kew, near the mouth of the Brent, piles have been disclosed to
view, marking as is supposed the site of an ancient “water-town;”
and at Barnes, in the opposite bend of the stream, similar remains
have been observed associated with flints, celts, and other primitive
relics. Well-authenticated lacustrine sites have been discovered
at Wretham Mere, in Norfolk;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> at Barton Mere, near Bury St.
Edmund’s;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> on Cold Ash Common, Berks;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and in Llangorse lake,
near Brecon, South Wales.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Munro is of opinion that the lake dwellings of Scotland
were erected by the semi-Romanized Celtic inhabitants, as a means
of protection when they were left to contend against the attacks
of the Angles, the Picts, and the Scots, upon the withdrawal of
the Roman legions from Britain; but when Cæsar arrived on the
banks of the Thames the use of wooden stakes, palisading, and
piles, for defensive purposes, was, as described by him,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> common
amongst the Britons&mdash;defences which were in fact of the nature
of the palisading with which Irish and Scotch lake dwellings were
surrounded. These works seem to have been of an enduring
character, for the Venerable Bede, writing at the commencement
of the eighth century, states that some of the stakes retained
their position even in his day. A very interesting account given
by Adulfeda, Syrian Prince and historian, who wrote about the
commencement of the fourteenth century, depicts the Apamæan
lake as a collection of small sheets of water of little depth, linked
together by huge swamps. The string of lakelets was margined
with dense borders of reeds, flags, and willows, and abounded in
game and fish. Adulfeda describes the most northerly lake of
this chain as “commonly called the lake of the Christians, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
it is inhabited by Christian fishermen who live here on the lake
in wooden huts built upon piles.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Venice, the once proud Queen of the Adriatic, the whilom mart
of Europe, with her lofty campanile, her beautiful temples, and her
marble palaces, rising vision-like from her watery bed, was in origin
but a cluster of fisher huts perched on piles in the shallow lagoons
at the mouth of the Po, a site selected by these toilers of the sea
for security and refuge from the ravages of the Huns under Attila.
In the commencement of the sixteenth century, when the Spaniards
marched on Mexico, “they saw, as they passed along, several large
towns resting on piles, and reaching far into the water, a kind of
architecture which found great favour with the Aztecs.” These
first founders of what now is the city of Mexico, after enduring the
casualties and hardships of a migratory life, at length resolved to
erect a permanent abode; and to protect themselves from their surrounding
enemies, laid the foundations of the future city “by
sinking piles into the shallows, for the low marshes were half
buried under water: on these they erected their light fabrics of
reeds and rushes, and sought a precarious subsistence from fishing,
and from the wild fowl which frequented the waters, as well as
from the cultivation of such simple vegetables as they could raise
on their floating gardens.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The Spaniards who first visited the
shores of Maracaibo, to the North of the South American Continent,
found the natives living in huts on piles in the water. They
named the locality Venezuela <i>i. e.</i> “Little Venice”: that name
now embraces a forest tract as large as France, a mountain tract
larger than Switzerland, and steppes like those of Mongolia.
Vasco Nunez failed in an attack on a tribe in Dabaybe, who
lived in huts stretching from tree trunk to tree trunk growing in
a watery swamp. The city of Tchakash is built over the river
Don, and it has been suggested that the huts raised on piles by
the fishermen of the Bosphorus may represent there the last
lingering traces of an ancient custom.</p>

<p>Captain Hiram Cox, in his <i>Journal of a Residence in the Burmhan
Empire</i>, written in the year 1796-7, describes the villages along
the banks of the Rangoon river as “built of bamboo and cadjan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
raised on piles in the manner of the Malays,” and throughout his
diary he makes frequent allusion to this singular custom. Forrest
says that in many parts of the coast of New Guinea the people live
in huts placed on stages erected on posts, as a means of protection
against the attacks of their enemies, the Haraforas, from the interior
of the country. On these stages they haul up their proas or
canoes. Similar structures have been described by travellers in the
Celebes, the Caroline Islands, and elsewhere in Polynesia.</p>

<p>D’Albertes, in his <i>New Guinea</i>, states that the house inhabited
by him at Salwatee was suspended over the sea on piles, and adds,
“all, or nearly all, the houses are built like ours, on piles, and are
surrounded by water at high tide, some indeed at all times, and the
people go to and fro by means of a bridge made of the trunks of
small trees. At a distance of little more than half a mile there is
another small village.” On the river Ramoi, D’Albertes saw four
or five houses built on piles about 20 feet high; and when describing
a native village, of the people of Mausniam, he states that all
“the houses are built on wooden piles driven into the sea, and
approached by a bridge constructed of the trunks of small trees.”
At Lorony nearly the entire village was over the water. “The
houses of Mafor are built entirely in the water, so that a little
bridge is necessary to enter them from the shore.” “The Arfahs
live in small villages, in houses built on piles.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In the bay of Dorei, in New Guinea, there are four villages
erected on piles over the sea. Each village contains from eight to
fifteen houses; each house consists of a row of distinct rooms, and
contains several families. These structures are entirely formed of
wood very roughly finished. The same writer states, “Formerly
the entire town of Tondano was erected in the lake, the only
means of communication from one house to another being by boat.
In the year 1810, relying on the strength of this position, the
inhabitants, who were at strife with the Dutch, tried to shake off
their yoke, took up arms, and were beaten. It was with difficulty
the Dutch succeeded in subduing them, for which purpose they had
to employ artillery and to build gunboats. To avoid a repetition
of similar troubles, the natives were forbidden in the future to construct
their dwellings on the lake.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>The dwellings of the Dyaks are described by the Bishop of
Labuan as “built along the river side on an elevated platform
20 or 30 feet high, in a long row, or rather it is a whole village in
one row of some hundreds of feet long. The platforms are first
framed with beams, and then crossed with laths about two inches
wide and two inches apart.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Munro draws attention to the
lake dwellings at Singapore, erected on a series of tall piles, the
flooring considerably above the surface of the water: in the intervening
space light boats were suspended. It would also appear
that pile dwellings of circular shape are to be observed in parts of
Japan. Captain Cook notices the summer and winter habitations
of a tribe called Tschutski in Kamtschatka. The winter lodge
is sunk below the surface; the summer, raised above the ground
and constructed on a platform supported on poles.</p>

<p>Whilst staying at Maracaibo, in Venezuela, a traveller took
great interest in a singular tribe of Indians called Guajiros, who
lived near the town in “pile dwellings.” He was conveyed to
his destination in a rude canoe, formed simply of the hollowed-out
trunk of a tree. On reaching the village, the huts, with their low
sloping roofs, were seen to be perched on high piles over the
shallow waters, and to be connected with each other by narrow
plank bridges formed of the split stems of palm trees. To enter
the huts, the visitor had to climb an upright pole by means of
notches cut in the side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> “Each house or cock-loft consisted of two
parts, the pent-roof shelter being partitioned off in the middle; the
front apartment served the double purpose of entrance hall and
kitchen; the rear apartment as a reception and dwelling chamber,
and it was not a little surprising to observe how clean it was kept.
The floor was formed of split stems of trees, set close together,
and covered with mats. Weapons and utensils were placed in order
in the corners.… The positions chosen for their erection are near
the mouths of rivers and in shallow waters; the piles on which
they rest are driven deep into the oozy bottom, and so firmly do
they hold that there is no shakiness of the loftily-perched dwelling
perceptible, even when crowded with people.… They are the
invention, not exactly of savages, but of tribes of men in a very
primitive stage of culture: such probably were the people who
lived in the prehistoric lake dwellings of Switzerland.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Similar
habitations are to be found</p>

<p class="noindent">and on the banks of the Amazon they are also to be seen perched
on piles driven into the muddy bottom. The delta of the Parana,
which is scarcely above high-water mark, is called the Venetia of
South America. Here the houses are built on piles in order to keep
the flooring free from the sudden rising of floods. Near Rosario, in
Buenos-Ayres, <i>gauchos</i>, who have given up horses and horse stealing
and taken to canoes and petty larceny, have constructed rude abodes
in the swamps along the banks of one of the tributaries of the La
Plata.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Captain Burton mentions an African tribe who had erected
their dwellings in the same way at a great distance from the shore.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Lake Moyhrga or Realmah, in Central Africa, presents at the present
day the characteristic features pertaining to the descriptions
of an ancient Irish lacustrine site. Cameron<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> describes this lake as
lying in a small basin embosomed in low-wooded hills, interspersed
with patches of cultivated ground. The lake is small&mdash;only two
miles in length by one in width&mdash;the margin girt with floating
vegetation corresponding to the reeds, flags, and aqueous growth
of more temperate climes. Three villages, besides detached huts,
were scattered irregularly over its surface: the huts were built on
platforms raised about six feet above the surface of the water, supported
on stout piles driven into the bed of the lake; underneath
the platform canoes were moored and nets hung to dry. Some
huts were oblong in shape, others round, with occasionally, a projecting
roof over the door, and they were constructed in a manner
precisely similar to those on <i>terra firma</i>. The inmates live in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
dwellings with their fowl and goats, only going ashore in their
“dug-outs” to cultivate their small patches of tillage, and to
allow their goats to graze. These lake-dwellers were very unapproachable
when on land, always running to their canoes and
paddling away on the appearance of a stranger. The paddles are
described as resembling large circular shallow spoons with long
straight handles, the canoes about 25 feet in length. In Eastern
Africa also pile dwellings are to be found, as at Mayunga, in
Madagascar. At Mirambaus, in Eastern Africa, the score or so
of houses composing the village are constructed on posts raised
some 8 feet above the ground,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> whilst in the neighbouring village
of Mujurumbe huts formed of bamboo and cocoa-nut leaf are erected
on piles. Thus we see that a habitat on the water has been, or is
still, used by races of men not having the slightest affinity to each
other, as the boat-living population of China, the lake-dwellers of
Central Africa, Europe, New Guinea, Great Britain, Ireland, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="LAKE_DWELLINGS" id="LAKE_DWELLINGS"></a>Although in 1810 a lake-dwelling in Ireland had been discovered
by Mr. William Trench near Roscrea, Co. Tipperary, its
original use was not known, no interest was excited, nor was the
importance of the event appreciated; and it was not till 1839<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> that
the archæological value of the investigation of lacustrine sites was
perceived. The following year Mr., afterwards Sir William, Wilde
published an account of the discovery at Lagore, Co. Meath, of the
first great lacustrine retreat noticed in Ireland in modern times.
It had been anciently the residence of the chief of a small territory
in Meath. The formation or eruption of the lake is chronicled in
the Irish Annals as having occurred <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> 3581. Under dates <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
848, 933, 967 mention is made of the destruction of the Lagore
crannog, and from its being situated near the village of Dunshaughlin,
either name is indiscriminately applied to it in the
present day. W. F. Wakeman, the only archæologist probably
now living who can speak from personal knowledge of the circumstances
connected with the original discovery, relates that, when
he was with Petrie in the office of the Topographical Department
of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, he recollects how a dealer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Irish antiquities, named Underwood, made his appearance day
after day, bringing for sale objects of more or less archæological
interest, which he stated had been found near Dunshaughlin.
Struck by the frequency of the dealer’s calls, Petrie decided to
unravel the mystery by visiting the place; accordingly, accompanied
by Wilde, he reached Lagore House, and there, carelessly
thrown on the floor of a barn, he saw a large and miscellaneous
collection of antiquities, consisting chiefly of weapons composed of
iron&mdash;swords, daggers, spear and axe-heads, saws, chains, shears,
small culinary vessels, &amp;c. &amp;c; pins and brooches of bronze,
articles of bone, and even of wood, all of which had been found
by labourers engaged in making a drain through the ancient lake
bed. Petrie endeavoured to procure some of these for his collection,
but the steward, or caretaker, in the absence of his employer,
would not part with any; and when the dealer returned after a
short lapse of time the collection was already greatly scattered:
many objects had been presented to curiosity-seekers in the
neighbourhood, and many, it was supposed, went to England.
A few, however, found their way to the Royal Irish Academy,
to Dean Dawson, Lord Talbot de Malahide, and Petrie.</p>

<p>For some years after the drainage operations, the soil of
Lagore remained unturned by the spade; but in 1846, 1847 and
1848, the site of the crannog was reopened by men engaged in the
process of turf-cutting, and, as on the previous occasion, quantities
of bones were exhumed, and with them a surprising number
of antiquities, together with remains of the ancient stockading,
and the ruins of several structures evidently used as huts; one
of them is thus described by W. F. Wakeman: “Let the reader
imagine a foundation formed of four roughly-squared planks of
oak, each about twelve feet in length (so arranged as to enclose a
quadrangle), the ends of which were carefully fitted together.
From the angles of this square rose four posts, also of oak, to the
height of about nine feet. In these grooves were cut, into which
roughly-split planks of oak had been slipped so as to form the
sides of the house; the irregularities between the boards were
tightly caulked with moss; a low and narrow opening in one of
the sides had evidently served as an entrance. There were no
traces of window or chimney.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Lagore crannog differed from others brought to light at a
later date, in not being either submerged or surrounded by water
at the time of its discovery. Wilde describes it as consisting of a
circular mound of about 520 feet in circumference, slightly raised
above the surrounding bog or marshy ground, which forms a basin
of about a mile and a-half in circuit, and is bounded by elevated
lands. “The circumference of the circle was formed by upright
posts of black oak, measuring from six to eight feet in height; these
were mortised into beams of similar material laid flat upon the
marl and sand beneath the bog, and nearly sixteen feet below the
present surface. The upright posts were held together by connecting
cross-beams, and (said to be) fastened by large iron (?)
nails: parts of a second upper tier of posts were likewise found
resting on the lower ones. The space thus enclosed was divided
into separate compartments by septa or divisions that intersected
one another in different directions; these were also formed of oaken
beams in a state of great preservation, joined together with greater
accuracy than the former, in some cases having their sides grooved
and rabbeted to admit large panels driven down between them.”</p>

<p>It may be inferred that fire was the final agent of destruction,
as almost everywhere amongst the timbers lay half-consumed
logs and numerous pieces of charcoal. Unfortunately, investigations
on the site do not seem to have produced results such
as might have been expected, owing principally, as was supposed,
to want of friendly co-operation on the part of those engaged
in searches. The “find” is now widely dispersed, and can never
be re-collected; but the Petrie Museum deposited in the Royal
Irish Academy, as well as some private cabinets, would still furnish
material for scores of illustrations.</p>

<p>At about the same date as the Lagore crannog, that of Lough
Gur, Co. Limerick, became visible when the waters of the lake
were lowered. The existence of this artificial island in ancient
times was traditionally known to the neighbouring peasantry:
the stones by which it was overlaid were in places distinctly visible
to a person passing over them in a boat when the lake level was
low and the water calm. A large tripod composed of iron was
at times plainly to be seen, and had attracted Mr. Wakeman’s
attention; but, from superstitious feelings on the part of the boatmen
by whom he was accompanied, no attempt at its recovery was
then made; it is said to be now in the collection of the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Irish Academy. A number of antiquities have been from time to
time obtained from the site, and there was a vast collection of
bones; but, according to the evidence of a clergyman then living
in the neighbourhood of Bruff, there does not appear to have been
any vestige of staking on or around this crannog. Other remains
of the same class were brought to light in rapid succession, so that
in 1857 no less than forty-seven of them had been recorded: since
that time the number has increased to about 200, and every succeeding
year adds to the total.</p>

<p>In 1853-4, owing principally to the writings of Keller, the
entire attention of archæologists was attracted to the lacustrine
remains of Switzerland, and it was the more easily diverted from
the Irish sites by the pronouncement of Sir William Wilde, that
no stone, and but few bronze weapons, had been found in them:
he also suggested, that from the ninth to the seventeenth century
might be considered the probable date of the lacustrine period in
Ireland. These theories have since been abundantly confuted; but
they served at the time to check investigation, because detracting
from the impression of antiquity.</p>

<p><i>Crannog, derivation of the word.</i>&mdash;In the Irish Annals, lake-dwellings
are called crannogs, derived from the term <i>crann</i>, which
signifies a tree. That word, always spelled with a double <i>n</i>, is in
Irish generally applied to a tree with foliage and branches, as
<span class="gaelic">crann na coille</span>, <i>trees of the wood</i>, but in its primary meaning it
refers to some massive object of timber standing erect&mdash;as stems
of the forest, or a ship’s mast, which is also called <span class="gaelic">crann</span>. The last
syllable in <span class="gaelic">crannog</span>, <i>i.e.</i> <span class="gaelic">og</span>, is the terminal form of numerous Irish
words; “sometimes it carries the force of a diminutive, but more
frequently not. <span class="gaelic">Crannog</span> is no doubt formed in the same manner
as <span class="gaelic">cuaróg</span>, the name usually applied to a wild bee’s nest, and
derived from the noun <span class="gaelic">cuar</span>, any conical hollow with the diminutive
ending <span class="gaelic">og</span> attached thereto. In some country places, the old
kind of pulpit or form was called crannóg, and in others <i>crannghail</i>
or <i>crannghaoil</i>, a word of somewhat similar meaning. This
latter word, too, was the Irish term for a hurdle, and was commonly
used for those wicker-chimneys so common formerly in
country cottages.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>It is doubtful whether the term <i>crannog</i> was originally applied
to the timber framework of which the island was constructed, or to
the wooden huts erected on it; though now-a-days it is generally
understood to include the whole structure, both island and dwelling.
In its topographical sense, the word is applied to wooden
lake dwellings, but in another sense the Anglo-Irish employed it
to designate a basket, hamper, or measure of a certain size for
measuring or gauging grain or corn.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> G. H. Kinahan states<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
that, although “crannog” is now the generally-accepted appellation
for the ancient lake dwellings of Ireland, it is, nevertheless, “a
modern term introduced to supply the place of the ancient one,
which is unknown or unrecognized.”</p>

<p>Lake dwellings bore in Scotland the same designation. In a
document dated 14th April, 1608, directed to State officials, concerning
the surrender of some rebellious clans, it is ordered, that
“the haill houssis of defence, strongholdis and <i>cranokis</i> in the yllis
perteining to thame and their foirsaidis sal be delyveret to his
Maiestie,” &amp;c. Although the term crannog is to be found in the
Irish Annals, yet in the earliest entries these dwellings are designated
simply as <i>Inish</i>, i. e. island: for instance, in an old Irish <span class="smcapuc">MS.</span>,
“The wars of the Gaedhiel with the Gaill,” it is recorded that,
in the year 1013, Brian Boru repaired inir locha Gair, i. e. <i>the
island</i> of Lough Gur, county Limerick, which is one of the most
important as also apparently one of the most ancient Irish lacustrine
sites; for, as before stated, remains of the reindeer, the
<i>Megaceros Hibernicus</i>, and bear, were found in the lake bed.</p>

<p><i>Crannog, a common Townland Name.</i>&mdash;There are numerous
localities throughout Ireland in which the term “crannog” is
embodied in the name, and where, consequently, must have been
formerly a lake or swamp, with its accompanying artificial
island, although in some cases the lake has now disappeared, and
the swamp has been drained. In most of the districts in which
these islands were found several small lakes are clustered together.
In Connaught, near the demesne of Longford, county Sligo, the
residence of Sir Malby Crofton, Bart., in a small pond, almost dry
in summer, there is an islet, still called by the country people
“crannog:” it has bequeathed its name to the townland in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
it is situated, <i>i.e.</i> “Lochanacrannog,” signifying the <i>little lake
of the crannog</i>.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In the parish of Cloonclare, county Leitrim, is a
locality called Crannog Island. In Connemara, county Galway,
there is an island in Ballinahinch lake which has given name
to a parish and to a barony, the word Ballinahinch signifying
<i>village of the island</i>. In Ulster there is a townland in county Tyrone
called Crannog. In county Donegal, Crannog-boy, or the <i>yellow
lake dwelling</i>, was the head quarters of The O’Boyle, a steady
supporter of the O’Donnels. In county Antrim, Lough Crannagh,
situated over Fair Head, probably derives its name from a
small artificial island which lies in the centre of the lake.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In
Loughmacnean, county Fermanagh, are several artificial islets, one
of which is called “Crannog Island.” In Leinster there is a
townland in county Kilkenny called Cronoge. In Munster there
is a place in the parish of Ardagh, county Limerick, called Coolcranoge,
<i>the angle of the lake dwelling</i>. “Crannog Island,” “sunken
island,” “drowned island,” “Inish,” or “the island,” are common
designations for diminutive artificial islets, showing themselves
above water only during summer drought in many lakes throughout
the kingdom. There is hardly a large sheet of water to which
is not attached a tradition of a frightful outbreak of flood, covering
what was formerly “a town;” or which does not possess its legend
of an enchanted well, which, consequent upon some affront offered
to its guardian spirit, covered the valley, its inhabitants, and houses.
May not these traditions be traceable to lingering remembrance of
former lacustrine habitations, for Giraldus Cambrensis, writing in
the twelfth century, described the tradition that then prevailed in
the north of Ireland, of waters having overwhelmed the plains
now occupied by Lough Neagh, a locality the most thickly studded
with these remains; and the legend has been immortalized by
Moore, who thus alludes to it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“On Lough Neagh’s banks as the fisherman strays,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">When the calm clear eve’s declining,</div>
<div class="verse">He sees the round towers of other days</div>
<div class="verse indent4">In the waves beneath him shining.”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>
<p>Similar legends of submerged towns are prevalent in the south
of Scotland, on the littoral facing the Irish coast. In the neighbourhood
of Carlingwark Loch, Kircudbrightshire, in which are
sites of crannogs, there has been from time immemorial a tradition
that “there had been a town in the loch which sunk or was
drowned;”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> whilst a Scotch writer states that, “amongst other points
of coincidence between Scotch and Irish crannogs may be noticed
a tradition connected with some of them, common to both countries,
which seems to have arisen from the submersion of the island
homes by the rising of the waters in the loughs.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The same
idea is held by the natives of Central India: “from this hill is
heard the sound of fairy drums; in that lake are seen reflected
the ruins of a buried city.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The tradition of towns buried beneath the waters is not confined
merely to the lakes of Ireland: there is the beautiful fable of the
City of Gold, hid beneath the angry ocean, sometimes seen, but
ever in different localities:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Yet at times the waves sever,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And then you may view</div>
<div class="verse">The yellow walls ever</div>
<div class="verse indent2">’Neath the ocean’s deep blue.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Submarine Crannogs.</i>&mdash;After a very high tide at Ardmore, near
Youghal, the waters retired more than customary, disclosing the
fact that this particular portion of the sea-shore had been the site
of a forest, as remains of trees were found in various parts of the
submarine deposit. This submerged tract extends to between the
four and five fathom line, but it has not been ascertained to what
further distance it may stretch seaward. A bank of shingle having
shifted by a change of current, laid bare the substructure of an
undoubted crannog: at high water it was covered by the tide to a
considerable depth. Either this dwelling had been erected when
Ireland was joined to Great Britain, or it was existent when Ireland
was at a greater elevation above the sea, and therefore of
greater extent than at present. The theory is enunciated by
eminent geologists that many of our present harbours had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
inland lakes in prehistoric times, and thus the Bay of Ardmore
may have formerly presented a similar appearance to the Gulf or
Lake of Maricaibo in Venezuela at the present day.</p>

<p>In the Irish Records, lake dwellings are likewise designated
“Stockaded Islands,” and in the <i>Ulster Inquisitions</i> of 1605, the
term applied to them is <i>insula fortificata</i>. Although antiquarians
have differed in opinion respecting the age of these remains, yet
after patient analysis of the characteristic features of the numerous
excavations made in recent years, the weight of evidence seems
to indicate that these constructions <i>were of all ages</i>, some being
very ancient; it is quite apparent that they have been built and
rebuilt, and in them have been found implements of stone, bronze,
and iron in their respective strata. It would seem, indeed, that
the “age of bronze” had in many instances largely overlapped
that of iron. The chronology of this period is a subject that has
not as yet been determined, and the time when it commenced
and when it ended is still unsettled.</p>

<p><i>Favourite Sites for Crannogs.</i>&mdash;Marshes, small loughs surrounded
by woods, and large sheets of water, were alike suitable for the
home of the Irish lake-dweller, his great and primary need
being protection; he was bound by no conventional engineering
rule, he did not exclusively employ wood, but appears to have been
guided by surrounding circumstances. On peaty or muddy sites
a wooden substructure was essential; on hard bottoms, stone, gravel,
or earth were, if convenient, employed. As providing good fishing
grounds, the entrance or exit of stream from lake was a favourite
site, and natural shoals thus placed were eagerly selected.</p>

<p><i>Mode of Construction of.</i>&mdash;Having decided on the position, the
<i>crannog</i> builder set to work by driving stakes into the bottom of
the lake in a circle of from sixty to eighty feet in diameter, a considerable
length of the stake sometimes projecting above the water;
these were in many instances joined together by horizontal beams,
the interior filled up by branches of trees, stones, gravel, earth,
and bracken. Often an inner row (or more than one) of piling is
found about five feet distant from the outer, and piles are driven
in various parts of the interior, either to consolidate the mass or to
act as stays for the walls of the dwelling. Next were placed one or
two layers of round logs, cut into lengths of about six feet, generally
mortised into the upright piles, kept in position by layers of
stone, clay, and gravel. In some cases, where the foundation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
soft, the superincumbent layers of timber were of great depth; in
other cases, where the bottom of the lake was firm, the platform of
timber was confined to a portion of the island. The side most
affected by the action of the water was frequently strengthened by
rows of piles, sometimes five or six deep, as well as by a breakwater
of stones.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> On the foundation, when raised sufficiently above the
water, the dwelling was erected; the hearth was in the centre of
the island, for in almost every case a collection of flag-stones has
been discovered in the interior of the enclosure, bearing on them
marks of fire. At times several hearths occur. In some instances
there are indications of these structures having had additions made
to their height at various times, either to keep pace with the chronic
rising of the level of the lough; or, taking into consideration the
compressible nature of the component parts of the foundation, the
island may have required increased elevation, owing to the effect
of natural subsidence. The enormous amount of wood employed
in the formation of a crannog, despite the mass of stones and other
material with which it was laden, must have had at first a buoyant
tendency, but according as the wood became completely saturated
with water, consolidation of a more or less pronounced character
would, in the course of time, become observable. The stones deposited
over the lower strata of fern, bracken, and branches, were
indubitably used to compress and solidify the substructure, as
likewise were the stones on the upper strata used for a similar
purpose. Considerable ingenuity was displayed in the formation of
these island homes, which were frequently constructed in a depth
of twelve to fourteen feet of water; and, apart from having served
in their day as secure retreats for large numbers of persons,
they have proved their durability by resisting successfully the
ravages of time, which may be reckoned by centuries.</p>

<p>The Scottish lake dwellings were formed in almost identically
the same manner; in fact, the structural details are so completely
analogous as almost to necessitate the belief of their having been
erected by the same race. Up to the present time, out of the fifty-three
lake dwellings constructed of timber, discovered in Scotland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
thirty-three have been found in Wightown,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Kirkcudbright,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>

greater number of those found in Ireland are situate on the opposite
coast, <i>i.e.</i> in Ulster.</p>

<p class="caption">Excavation in a Crannog in Loughrea,
showing wicker-work wall and basket
flooring.</p>
</div>

<p>G. H. Kinahan, who explored crannogs in four localities,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
states that in all of them floors
of wicker- or basket-work were
found. The first discovered by
him was in the large crannog of
Loughrea. In one of the excavations
there became apparent a perpendicular
single wicker-work wall
or partition that went down to the
level of the basket flooring; from
it, for eleven feet towards the north
there was a rough pavement, on
which was a thin layer of gravel.
The surface of the pavement was on
a level with the basket flooring.
The rods of which it was composed
were soft and rotten&mdash;in fact reduced
to mould, gave no resistance
to the spade, and might easily
escape ordinary observation. The
heads of the piles forming the partition
walls may, according to this authority, be seen in an unexcavated
crannog near Strokestown, county Roscommon. There seems,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
therefore, reason to suppose that all piles situated in the interior
of crannogs point out the direction of the partition wall
or walls of the habitations, as, whatever may otherwise have been
the mode of construction&mdash;whether of wicker-work or rods&mdash;they
were supported at intervals by piles. May not the so-called basket
flooring have been a portion of the wattle walls which had fallen
down? Other experts on the subject have been unable in their explorations
to detect the presence of wicker-work floors; but in the
year 1858, in a small island about 200 yards from the shore, in the
lake formed by the Shannon at Castleforbes, county Longford, the
Earl of Granard discovered traces of stockading and piling, together
with a coarse sort of wicker-work.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> This, however, was in
the encircling palisades, and W. F. Wakeman has recently noticed
similar remains around the crannog of Lisnacroghera.</p>

<p><i>Stone Lake Dwellings.</i>&mdash;On some of these artificial islands the
last structures seemed to have been formed of stone: for example,
in Loughtamand, county Antrim, a stone house or castle, the
stronghold of the MacQuillans, replaced a circular structure composed
of wood; a similar change seems to have been made in one
of the crannogs of Loughrea. The transition from buildings of
wood to those of stone has also been observed in Scotland.
Mention may be made of a few stone-built island fortresses; and
although, strictly speaking, the term “crannog” is scarcely applicable,
yet many of them that present a modern appearance are
structures erected on ancient foundations. In parts of Galway
and Mayo, where timber was either scarce or of stunted growth,
buildings of stone seem to be most numerous, whilst in Ulster
they occur in the rocky districts of Antrim and Donegal.</p>

<p>Goromna Island, in Lough Hilbert, county Galway, is a peculiar
structure, which, though not formed of wood, is somewhat allied
to a crannog, being wholly or in part an artificial island. A large
and good specimen, <i>Caislen-na-Caillighe</i>, or the Hag’s Castle, stands
in Lough Mask. It is one of the oldest fortresses mentioned in
the Irish Annals, being noticed at the date <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1195. In 1233
the Anglo-Norman castle erected on its site was demolished by
Felim O’Conor, chief of Connaught, and so late as 1586 it was with
difficulty captured by Sir Richard Bingham. This great circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
enclosure, ninety feet in diameter and thirty feet in height, occupies
almost the entire island. The walls, which are still eight feet in
depth at top, exhibit the characteristic inward slope peculiar to the
cashel; its situation near the mouth of a river (the Robe) is characteristic
of crannogs. In Lough Bola there is a curious cashel, or
stone lake dwelling; the accompanying sketch gives an idea of
its present appearance. A primitive habitation lies in Lough Cam,
north of Roundstone, and two miles west of Toombeola. All these
islands have a crannog-like aspect. To the south of Ballinahinch
lake lies that of Ballinafad, and in its northern portion there
becomes visible, when the water is low, a circle of stones and a
small island, evidently the remains of some artificial structure.
O’Flahertie, in his <i>History of Iar-Connaught</i>, mentions that the
ancient castle of the O’Flaherties of Bunowen, in the lake of
Ballinahinch, was built on an artificial island: this had been constructed
by one of the original septs long prior to the occupation of
the country by the O’Flaherties, who in their turn were driven out
by the Martins.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><i>Theory of Crannogs being only Temporary Refuges.</i>&mdash;The opinion
has been frequently advanced that crannogs were merely refuges
used in case of hostile incursion&mdash;not a general or habitual residence;
and if a rath chance to be in the immediate vicinity, it is
pointed out as the abode of the chief on shore. The great mass
of bones, however, and remains of household gear, found upon and
around some of the sites, point conclusively to their having been places
of residence for long and various periods, and many of them bear
signs which denote their having been often demolished, burnt, and
rebuilt, the Celt clinging to his watery home with as much pertinacity
as in latter days he clings to his cottage on terra firma. Keller
was of opinion that the great distinction between the continental pile
dwellings (<i>pfahlbauten</i>), and the crannogs of Ireland and kindred
lake dwellings of Scotland, is that the latter served merely as
places of refuge for chieftains, their families, and property, <i>i. e.</i>
strongholds belonging to individuals, whilst the Swiss lacustrine
dwellings were inhabited century after century by groups of families;
here they fabricated their pottery, their utensils, their wearing
apparel, their fishing implements, their weapons of warfare; and
hence in Swiss waters rows of huts are found, each furnished with
its hearth and its weaving loom. Although Irish and Scottish
lacustrine dwellings may have been the abode of chiefs, yet the clan
clustered around them, for in many Irish lakes a large crannog is
observable, whilst in close proximity&mdash;sometimes connected with
it&mdash;are others of smaller size and meaner construction; might we
not fairly surmise that the larger one was the abode of the chief, the
others those of his followers? The theory that these dwellings were
places of merely temporary refuge can be refuted on many grounds.
The evidences of repeated renovations and re-erection of crannogs
after having been burnt,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> also the traces of cattle, which appear to
have been kept in them, the enormous quantity of bones contained
in the kitchen middens, the hearths, the remains of fire, of cooking
utensils, of spindle whorls, of household gear, the domestic arrangements
made in each hut for the accommodation of a family, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
various articles for personal adornment and for amusement, all
tend to denote continuous occupancy; finally, we must bear in
mind the enormous expenditure of time and labour that would be
required for erection of what was, on such a theory, to serve only
as a place of temporary shelter.</p>

<p><i>Palisades and Dwellings.</i>&mdash;Palisaded fortifications are unquestionably
very primitive. Around the cyclopean wall of Dun
Ængus and other prehistoric forts in the Isles of Arran, county
Galway, are found palisades, or <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>, of sharp-pointed
stones, and such defences have in all ages proved effective under
skilful management. Even in the present advanced state of
military science, the various wars in New Zealand have demonstrated
the formidable nature of the Maori pah or fort. The
outer range of piles around crannogs rose considerably above
the water, and thus formed a stockade or breastwork for repelling
an attack from enemies. The Lord Deputy Sidney, describing
to Elizabeth a repulse of her troops from one of these
retreats, says that at a distance it did not appear formidable,
as it was simply encircled with a stout palisade bristling with
rows of sharpened stakes; but when assaulted, the soldiers found
it impossible either to scale or undermine it. This style of defensive
work was of ancient origin in Ireland, for the Annals state
that, in the year 990, the island as well as “the dreach and
rampart of Lough Cimbe” (now Lough Hackett, county Galway)
were swept away by a violent storm.</p>

<p>Within the area enclosed stood the hut or huts in which the
families lived; the stockade served equally for shelter and defence,
fulfilling the same purpose as did the circumvallation of the rath
or <i>doon</i> on terra firma. Edifices constructed of logs, of wattling,
and hurdles daubed over with clay, and thatched with reeds, were
in early times considered characteristic of the Irish; even public
buildings were constructed of these materials. Bede states that an
Irish monk, who had been elected Bishop of Lindisfarn, built a
church for his see “altogether of sawn oak, and covered it with
reeds, after the manner of the Scots” (<i>i. e.</i> the Irish). We need
not, however, refer to history, or depend upon conjecture, in order
to reconstruct these island dwellings; for the foundations, and even
some of the log walls, have been exposed to view. Good examples
are presented by the flooring of an oblong house at Drumaleague,
county Leitrim, and at Cargaghoge, county Monaghan; remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of a wooden hut at Kilnock, county Antrim; and the following in
county Fermanagh&mdash;mortised beams at Loughavilly, a house at
Gortalough, angle posts at “The Miracles,” and lower framework
of a house at Ballydoolough. At Kilnamaddo, in the same county,
log huts were found buried under seventeen feet of peat; these were
practically almost perfect, wanting nothing save the roof; they
were very low, the side walls scarcely four feet in height, and they
might be looked upon rather as lairs for sleeping in, than dwellings
in the modern sense of the word; indeed, the primitive races of
Ireland, whether building in stone or wood, made use of low roofs
and consequently low doors. The openings left for egress and ingress
were probably closed by hurdles of wicker-work, as demonstrated
by the old Irish proverb, <i>Fuair se air suibhal eadar cliath
a’s ursainn</i> (he got off ’twixt hurdle and door-post), equivalent to
the saying, “he escaped by the skin of his teeth.”</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the townland of Kilnamaddo (<i>the
wood of the dog</i>) had apparently, in olden times, formed the basin of
a sheet of water, and upon one of its shoals some primitive tribe
had erected a habitation. The piling can still be traced, but the
chief antiquarian interest attached to the discovery consisted in the
remains of the huts already referred to, and which were constructed
of oak beams. They were two in number, stood about fifty feet
apart, and somewhat resembled the hut exposed to view by Captain
Mudge in Donegal, but differed from it in not being divided into
an upper and lower story. The Kilnamaddo huts were quadrangular,
and the larger and more perfect specimen measured on
the outside eleven feet six inches by ten feet. To make the
structure, four massive posts of oak, averaging seven feet in
length and seven feet in circumference, were set in the ground.
These timbers, near their upper ends, have mortised holes
averaging eleven inches in height by eight and a-half in
breadth, through which passed the ends of beams to which
slabs of oak were attached, and the floor was also composed of
oaken planks. The roof, as well as a great portion of the sides,
did not remain <i>in situ</i> at the time of the discovery, but a number
of timbers found immediately adjoining each of the structures were
admirably suited for the purpose of forming side walls and roofing.
The lower frame of the work appears to have been very similar to
that upon which the roof had rested. In the lower portions of the
four upright posts were very curious mortise holes, evidently intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
for the reception of beam ends. The sides of this edifice
were retained in position and pressed to the frame below by a row
of small, well-sharpened piles; no sign of pinning or grooving in the
upper portion of the frame could be discovered, therefore the conclusion
may be drawn that the huts were originally built within an
excavation, the peat was then heaped against the sides, probably
even over the roof, and a small passage left as an entrance. In
short, it was a structure of wood, but otherwise analogous to the
stone-lined chambers and passages so generally found in raths.
Almost in the immediate neighbourhood, may still be observed a
subterraneous work of uncemented stones, styled “St. Lasser’s
Cell.” In it are three very small, low-roofed chambers, connected
by passages equally low; but there is no reason to suppose they
had communication with any other structure, and, although named
after a “saint,” they rather convey the impression of pre-Christian
origin. Unlike the remains of most crannogs, that of Kilnamaddo
presented no indication of having been destroyed by fire; had
such been the case, the posts would have shown undoubted signs of
charring. Evident traces of a kitchen midden were discovered in
the bog close to the hut, but at a level slightly above it. The
height of the interior of the most perfect of the huts, without making
any allowance for a sloping roof, being only four feet, they
would thus correspond to the souterrains of a rath. It has been
suggested that they were used by the crannog occupants only
for the preservation of perishable commodities; and in seeming
corroboration of this theory, large lumps of the substance called
“bog-butter” were discovered in them carefully rolled up in
cowhide.</p>

<p>It is difficult to arrive at even an approximate estimate of the
age of these curious structures: the mortise-holes, pierced clean
through timbers more than seven feet in circumference, could hardly
have been formed by the aid of stone hatchets or chisels: several of
the piles and other portions of the work show traces of long, clean cuts,
such as are given by sharp metallic tools; yet the only implements
found here were of stone, and by the aid of such it is possible that
some of the timbers were more or less worked. The roots and part
of the trunk of a yew were found <i>in situ</i> in the bog, on a higher
level than the roof of the more perfect hut. It has been computed,
from the girth of this yew, that it would take at least one thousand
years to attain the bulk it showed when first laid bare, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
eleven feet of bog by which it was covered would take at least
another thousand years to grow.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><a href="#plate01">Plate <span class="smcap">I.</span>, fig. 4</a>, represents the most perfect of the Kilnamaddo
huts restored. When the drawing was taken, all the timbers in the
illustration were on the spot, and some of these retained their original
position. <a href="#plate01">Fig. 3</a> is a slab of oak measuring six feet by two feet
nine; it is not so thick as <a href="#plate01">fig. 2</a>, which represents a slab of oak five

depressions at its broader end being five inches by six, and it
is one foot two inches in thickness; this and <a href="#plate01">fig. 3</a> were found
lying by the side of the hut, and it is conjectured that they
formed a portion of the roof. <a href="#plate01">Fig. 1</a> represents an angle-post five
feet six inches in length, and four feet ten inches in circumference.
This style of construction appears, as far as is yet known, to have
been confined to the north-west portion of Ireland, the two somewhat
similar huts being those discovered by Captain Mudge in
Donegal, and by Mr. Morant in Monaghan.</p>

<p>A representation is given (<a href="#plate02">plate <span class="smcapuc">II.</span></a>) of the wooden hut discovered
in 1833, by Captain W. Mudge, R.N., in the bog of Drumkelin,
parish of Inver, county Donegal, it being the most perfectly preserved
primitive dwelling of that material yet brought to light in
Ireland. It was surrounded with a staked enclosure; portions of the
gates also were discovered. The flooring of the house (<a href="#plate03">plate <span class="smcapuc">III.</span>,
fig. 3</a>) rested on hazel branches covered with a layer of fine sand;
a paved causeway (<a href="#plate03">plate <span class="smcapuc">III.</span>, fig. 4</a>), over a foundation of hazel
branches and logs, led from the door of the house to a fireplace, on
and around which lay ashes, charred wood, and half-consumed turf.
This unique structure was nearly square, twelve feet wide, and
nine feet high, formed of rough logs and planks of oak, apparently
split by wedges, the interstices filled with a compound of grease and
fine sea sand. One side of the hut, supposed to be the front, was
left entirely open. The framework<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> consisted of upright posts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
horizontal sleepers, mortised at the angles, the end of each post
being inserted into the lower sleeper of the frame, and fastened
with a large block of wood. The discoverer states that the mortises
were very rough, as if made with a kind of blunt instrument,
the wood being bruised rather than cut, and it may be inferred that
a stone celt found lying upon the floor of the house was the identical
tool with which the mortises had been formed (<a href="#plate03">plate <span class="smcapuc">III.</span> figs.
6 and 7</a>). By comparing the chisel with the marks of the tool used
in making the mortises and grooves, it was found to correspond
exactly with them, even to the slight curved surface of the chisel;
but the logs had evidently been hewn with a larger instrument in
the shape of an axe, undoubtedly of stone, as the marks, though
larger than those the chisel would have made, are of the same
character, being somewhat hollow and small cuts, not presenting
the smooth surface produced by a common iron axe. A second but
larger stone was also found on the floor, which, being ground at one
end to an edge, was probably used as a wedge for splitting timber
(<a href="#plate03">plate <span class="smcapuc">III.</span> fig. 5</a>). There was also a flat freestone slab, measuring
three feet by one, and two inches thick, having a hollow in the
middle about three-fourths of an inch deep; large quantities of
whole and broken nuts were found near it, together with several
round shingle stones. The hollow in the flag is supposed to
have been a receptacle for the nuts, the small stones being used as
hammers to break them.</p>

<p>The depth at which the hut was buried, and
the flint and stone implements found in it, seem
to prove unquestionably its extreme antiquity;
added to which, upon the level of the floor, and
extending all around, were the corkers of a forest
of hard wood trees that had co-existed with the
occupation of this structure. Wood, in large
masses, when either thoroughly immersed in
water or buried under ground, lasts longer in a
semi-decomposed state than is generally supposed,
for calcined ends of timber antæ and
rafters were dug out from the pseudo site of
Troy.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>At the time of Captain Mudge’s discovery, so
little was known on the subject of lake dwellings,
that many were the conjectures floated in connexion
with this Donegal “find.” Now, however,
this famous log house is pronounced to be
simply a very well preserved example of the ordinary
crannog hut of an extremely early period, <i>i.e.</i> of a time
when axe-heads of stone were still in use, and when metal, if
known at all, was so precious that ordinary weapons were
occasionally at least formed out of hard wood. That the structure
in question occupied a crannog will be sufficiently obvious to
any inquirer who examines the model of it preserved in the Royal
Irish Academy. The stakes represented <i>in situ</i>, to the left of the
illustration (<a href="#plate02">plate <span class="smcapuc">II.</span></a>), are plainly remains of the stockade, one
timber of which appears in the foreground; and, in the sides of
the drain made to carry off the water from the excavation, Captain
Mudge observed a number of ends of large oak logs placed in
regular order, portion evidently of the usual crannog foundation.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In 1867, the remains of a dwelling brought to light in the townland
of Cargaghoge, near Carrickmacross, county Monaghan, is thus
described:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> A man engaged in cutting turf, having uncovered the
ends of three planks of oak, the circumstance, when reported to Mr.
G. Morant, induced him to have the superincumbent bog carefully
dug away, and after some hours’ work the floor of a house became
exposed to view; as the explorers approached its level, they were particularly
careful to examine
the layers next to it, in the
hope of discovering some
relics of its inhabitants; but,
beyond ashes, nutshells
(both in considerable quantities),
some pieces of very
rude pottery, and a few
small worked flints, nothing
was found. The floor, as
may be seen by the accompanying
engraving, is approached
by a narrow
causeway of black oak
planks, similar to those of
the floor itself, very rudely
formed, of unequal size,
and laid loosely, without
any apparent fastening, except
by occasional posts, as
marked on the sketch. At
the end of the causeway
nearest to the floor are the
remains of posts, which probably
formed the entrance
to the house, and at one
side is a large tree stump of some soft wood resembling sallow.
The timbers of both causeway and floor have evidently been
fitted to the boll of the tree, proving that it must have existed
before either the causeway or floor was laid. The latter sloped
at a considerable angle to the south-west, owing to the withdrawal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of the water from a small lake not far from the site of this
ancient floor; the bog in former days was at least fourteen feet
deep over it. In the memory of persons still living, this portion of
Cargaghoge was entirely covered with water. About the centre of
the floor was a collection of stone slabs, closely fitted together, with
a substratum of blue clay, but all laid on planks of timber forming
part of the floor. On this fireplace there was a quantity of ashes,
and on the edge of the hearth a small corn-crusher of stone. Underneath
the planks, as far as could be observed without disturbing
them, a thick deposit of hazel and birch branches formed a foundation
for the support of the flooring.</p>

<p>From the descriptions given in Irish <span class="smcapuc">MSS.</span>, it would appear as if
the very earliest wooden dwellings were either rectangular or of oblong
form, but there is absolute proof of the co-existence of circular
houses, made chiefly or wholly of wicker-work. Similar dwellings
of the Gauls are figured on Roman bas-reliefs; the plan of this
kind of house resembled a tent; the poles were driven into the
ground in a circle, the spaces between filled in with wicker-work,
and the interstices made weather-tight by daubing them with clay.
In the centre of the interior, a stout post, commensurate with the
required height of the conical roof point, was firmly erected, and
to this the rafters were attached, descending at a steep incline to the
upright wall poles. According as they radiated from the central
post their distance from each other correspondingly increased; in
these spaces cross-beams were inserted, and across the radial rafters
narrow slips of wood were fastened, forming a complete covering
from the conical point of the roof to the eaves; a sheeting of rods
was laid over this at right angles, and the framework of the roof
was then thatched with straw, rushes, or sedge bound down with
scollops.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><i>Gangways.</i>&mdash;Some crannogs were connected with the shore by a
wooden gangway supported on piles driven into the bed of the
lake. The artificial island in the lake of Effernan, county Clare,
affords a good example of this kind of passage. It has been often
stated that the characteristic feature of Irish lake dwellings was
their insularity, their complete disconnection with the land; yet it
would be tedious to enumerate the many instances in which remains
of both pile gangways and stone causeways have been discovered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
although with regard to the latter it is quite possible that
in some cases the so-called causeways may have been merely the
stones that had been deposited around the base of the piles, to give
solidity to the uprights supporting the footpath.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It has been
suggested that these gangways, being under the water level, were
meant to provide on sudden emergencies a means of secret access to
the crannog, and that their oblique, sometimes even tortuous, course
was for the purpose of preventing any but those accustomed to the
submerged path from making use of it. Is it not more probable
that the people who made it merely availed themselves either of a
shoal or of the best foundation into which uprights might be driven?
Wooden roads and causeways across the deep, treacherous morasses
and soft miry banks with which lake dwellings were environed
have been frequently discovered. A roadway, evidently made for
convenience of the crannog in Loughnahinch, county Tipperary,
was covered with a great accumulation of peat.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Another submerged
roadway, constructed somewhat like an American corduroy
road, was discovered in a bog between Castleconnell and the Esker
of Goig, in county Limerick.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> In the north portion of the Wexford
estuary was a causeway that in ancient times connected Begerin
to other islands; there were two rows of oak piles on which,
apparently, had formerly been transverse beams.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> In Duncan’s
flow bog, Ballyalbanagh, county Antrim, was a wooden roadway
laid on the surface of the <i>black</i> turf, level with stumps of deal
corkers; this road was seven feet wide, formed of longitudinal oak
beams sheeted with transverse
planking of the same material. In
the centre of the bog, where the
foundation was soft (<a href="#fig006">fig. 6</a>), there
were eight longitudinal beams,
whilst in the firmer ground (<a href="#fig007">fig. 7</a>), near the edge of the bog,
there were but three, one at each side and one in the centre.
The roadway, with the exception of one log, was formed entirely
of oak; holes worn in the oak planking had been mended (<a href="#fig008">fig. 8</a>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
with pieces of <i>deal</i> fixed in position across the aperture. “On the
roadway there are now five feet of uncut turf, while ten feet of
‘good turf’ are said
to have been cut
away. Over the
good turf there must
have been ‘white
turf’ and clearing, which would add
at least about five feet more to the
thickness of peat over the cash,” or
roadway.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> A paved causeway, covered
to the depth of eight or nine feet
with bog, leads down to what used
to be the edge of the water, at Kilnock
crannog, county Antrim.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> On an
ancient wooden causeway or road in
Ballykillen Bog, barony of Coolistown,
King’s County, a remarkable axe, formed of bone (<a href="#fig009">fig. 9</a>), was
found seven feet below the then surface of the bog; the axe
is eight inches long, and the sharp cutting edge at the
small extremity had been formed
by an oblique cut of the bone.
With it was a flint arrow-head
(<a href="#fig010">fig. 10</a>) in a briar-root shaft, the
thong which tied it still adhering.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>

<p><i>Kitchen Middens and Refuse Heaps.</i>&mdash;The most usual site of the
kitchen midden, or collection of refuse thrown out of the dwelling,
is at the entrance to the crannog, where was formerly the landing-stage
or gangway leading to the shore; and what more natural
than that prehistoric housekeepers should take the easiest method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
getting rid of refuse by merely throwing it out of the door, a practice
followed, on terra firma, by many of their descendants in
Ireland at the present day. The accumulated mass of bones
(invariably found in a broken state for extraction of the marrow) is
in some instances immense; it is estimated that at Dunshaughlin, in
Meath, about two hundred tons were sold for manure, three hundred
tons were exhumed from the kitchen midden of one of the
lake dwellings in Loughrea, county Galway, and fifty tons from
that of Ardakillen, county Roscommon; the bones in the heaps
have, evidently, in some instances, been gnawed by dogs after their
owners had extracted the marrow, for which dainty the Irish appear
to have had a peculiar relish, judging from their proverb, <i>Ma
bhris tu an cnamh char dhuighail tu an smior</i>, i. e., though you have
broken the bone, you have not sucked out the marrow: equivalent to
saying, “you have done the most difficult part of the work, though
you have not completed it.” Refuse heaps may be said to form
also a perfect mine of antiquities, for every “cast” article of household
gear was thrown into them; hence, the objects though numerous
are generally fractured. After bones the next most frequent
“find” consists of fragments of fictile ware. It has been remarked
that if the former site of a crannog becomes again exposed to the
light of day, by the <i>gradual</i> cutting away of the peat under which
it lay buried, perhaps during centuries, then many objects calculated
to excite the interest of archæologists might be turned up
from time to time without attracting particular notice, and thus no
means would be left to form even an approximate estimate of the
date of the crannog; but if careful examination be made of a
kitchen midden, exposed to view by the simple drainage of water
from the site, then the antiquities discovered afford tolerably
correct and safe data from which to calculate the age of the structure.</p>

<p><i>Canoes.</i>&mdash;Some crannogs appear to have been veritable islands,
the only means of communication with the land being by canoes;
of these, in Irish and Scottish waters alike, remains have been frequently
found near the dwelling, in some instances alongside the
landing-stage, as if sunk at their moorings.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> A canoe formed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
hollowing out the trunk of a tree seems to have been almost universally
the first attempt at boat-building, and to effect this, a
people even in the rudest state of existence would possess sufficient
ingenuity. Canoes are so universally found associated with
crannogs, that their discovery in lakes and bogs in Ireland has been
considered an indication of the existence of lacustrine dwellings in
the immediate vicinity; but it may be safely concluded that, unless
implements or articles of stone or bronze are found with “dug-outs,”
they do not of themselves carry us back to prehistoric times,
nor do they necessarily indicate the great antiquity commonly
attributed to them. Canoes have been found of the oldest type
known, and yet containing articles of iron of very modern form;
therefore, it may be surmised that a people of primitive habits
like the lake dwellers clung tenaciously to old customs, and their
models remained unchanged during many ages. Irish single-piece
canoes may be roughly divided into three classes or varieties&mdash;(1)
the first, generally either sharp or rounded at both extremities,
averages twenty feet in length, and about two in breadth, some
however have been discovered square at both ends. Again, some
are flat-bottomed and others round: the inside depth varies according
to their state of preservation; (2) the second kind is generally
of much greater length; one found, measuring forty feet, was
round in the bow, but square in the stern, which was formed of a
separate piece, let into a groove within a few inches of the extremity:
this make is altogether more heavy and clumsy than the
preceding; (3) the third variety is trough-shaped, and has been
appropriately designated “the portable canoe”; the length is from
eight to twelve feet; it is square at both ends, round in the bottom,
and having projecting handles at either extremity, apparently
for the convenience of carrying it from lake to lake. All alike
seem to have been hollowed out of a single tree, probably in the
fashion described by Captain Speke, in his <i>Travels in Central
Africa</i>, wherein he says the negroes fell a large tree, lop off the
branches, shape the timber, then cover its upper surface with wet
mud, as it lies on the ground, and set fire to it, burning out the
core, and finishing off with roughly-constructed hatchets the part
unconsumed by fire.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In Lough Owel, county Westmeath, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
immediate neighbourhood of a crannog, a very large canoe was
found in company with two of smaller size. The prow was in
shape like a curved beak; it might be expected that the principle
of the curve would have been carried out in its after end, but,
whilst the entry is spoon-shaped, the stern is square, and a hollow
but shallow groove cut at the very end was formerly filled by the
stern board. This canoe was round in the bottom; twenty-four
holes were drilled through the sides, and the same number through
the floor. A canoe twenty feet nine inches long, four feet seven
inches broad, and one foot eight inches deep, was found at Derryhollagh,
county Antrim; another in the lake of Moynalty was
twenty-four feet in length.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> One unearthed at Ardakillen measured
forty feet in length, by four feet across the bow,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> whilst
another in Drumaleague Lough, county Leitrim, was only eighteen
feet long by twenty-two inches broad&mdash;not formed for speed, certainly&mdash;being
square at stem and stern. A canoe at Cahore, in
Wexford, was twenty-two feet in length, two-and-a-half feet across
amidships, and eleven inches in depth (<a href="#plate04">plate <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span> fig. 1</a>). At a
place called Cornagall, about six miles from Cavan, was found one
more than half consumed by the conflagration which had destroyed
the crannog itself; in the bottom of this boat lay a complete set of
tools, belonging to an ancient craftsman who had lived at a period
subsequent to the adoption of iron tools.</p>

<p>The discovery of an ancient canoe beneath the waters of Lough
Erne was made in a somewhat romantic manner. A steamer
plying upon that lake attempted, in consequence of the unusual
height of the water, to make a short cut, but grounded on a bank,
and in so doing pushed upwards her ancient sister into the light of
day. The “dug-out” thus found is of oak, eight feet in length,
by one foot five and a-half inches in breadth, its internal depth
is seven and a-half inches, the sides averaging about an inch and
a-half in thickness. In shape it differs from any other canoe in
the Museum, Royal Irish Academy, and, taken as a whole, conveys
the idea of the elongated bowl of a table spoon; it also presents
a peculiar characteristic, in that a number of holes at almost regular
intervals, in sets of three, have been pierced through its floor;
there are three sets of these holes, each about an inch in diameter;
they cross the boat in threes, at right angles with a line drawn
through the middle from end to end.</p>

<p>During the operation of changing a line of road about a mile
and a-half from Enniskillen, the antique figured (<a href="#plate04">plate <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span> fig. 4</a>), was
exposed to view. Its position was almost equidistant from Lough
Erne and Lough Rossole. Owing to the smallness of its proportions
as regards beam, objections have been raised to its claim to be
classed as a canoe, and it has been suggested that it was perhaps a
brewing vat for manufacture of some kind of drink. Impossible to
say what the original length of this square and hollowed block of
oak may have been, but the remaining portion measures about fifteen
feet: the sides and bottom are thin, the depth is one foot, the
breadth at its remaining end only one foot three inches; that end,
however, is seven inches thick, and from it, on the exterior, two
handles cut out of the solid block project, as shown in the drawing.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
The great difference between the thickness of the sides and end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
may be accounted for by the presence of the handles, as they would
need to be attached to solid timber if required for use as lifting
agents; the diameter of these handles is about three inches, the
length six inches, and at the end, between the handles, there is a
hole by which this antique could be drained. If it be really a
canoe, the handles would prove most serviceable for the purpose
of transportation from one lake to another, and for the chase of
wild fowl on lake or river, would meet the requirements of the
primitive sportsman. A groove cut upon the interior of what may
be termed the remaining portion of the gunwale, seems as if
intended for reception of a covering in the style of an Esquimaux
canoe, and, owing to the extreme narrowness of the supposed
craft, this arrangement would be absolutely necessary for the
safety of the occupant.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> A portable single-piece oaken canoe
or trough of similar description, twelve feet in length, by three
in breadth, and furnished with handles, was found in the bog
of Ardagh, parish of Maghe-Ross, and is figured in Shirley’s
<i>Dominion of Farney</i>.</p>

<p>The foregoing furnish specimens of the three classes into which
canoes may be divided; in all, about fifty have been found in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Owing to the preservative properties of peaty matter, the
wood of some of these canoes was in a fairly sound state when dug
up: one of the largest and most perfect found in connexion with
the Strokestown crannogs, was cut up by a “grim utilitarian” for
roofing material, and the best canoe belonging to the Ballinderry
crannog was split into firewood.</p>

<p><i>Paddles.</i>&mdash;For the purpose of propelling a canoe paddles were
essential, and of these numbers have been discovered: there are
several in the Museum of the Royal Historical and Archæological
Association at Kilkenny, as also in the Museum of the Royal Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Academy, Dublin. The paddle, two feet seven inches long, by
five and a-half inches across the blade, as represented (in <a href="#plate04">plate <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span></a>
fig. 5), was found in the immediate neighbourhood of a crannog
site at Toome Bar, on the Lower Bann. It is the largest of two
from the same locality; both are imperfect, the handle of each
being fractured in the same spot, so that the original length cannot
be ascertained; but as they were not more than half an inch thick,
they could only have been employed in propelling a very light
craft, perhaps a portable canoe.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><i>Anchors.</i>&mdash;For the purpose of holding a canoe stationary an
anchor is requisite, but of these not more than three have as yet
been discovered. The one figured (<a href="#plate04">plate <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span> fig. 6</a>) is of stone. The
shank must have been of wood, lashed to the stone. There was
with the canoe discovered in the Boyne what bore the appearance
of a kind of wooden anchor. At Toome Bar was found an anchor or
grappling instrument twenty-one inches long, but being formed of
iron it should be viewed as comparatively modern (<a href="#plate04">plate <span class="smcapuc">IV.</span>
fig. 7</a>).</p>

<p><i>Curach.</i>&mdash;There is yet another kind of boat, the curach, that must
have been employed by these lake dwellers; of it, however, on
account of the perishable materials of which it was composed, no
remains have as yet been exhumed. We may all recollect, when
reading English history in our childhood, the description given
of the primitive Celtic boat, constructed of basket-work and covered
with skins, in which the Picts and Scots are said to have invaded
Britain in crowds, and of which the Britons themselves made use:
this is frequently referred to by old classical writers. Herodotus
mentions boats of this kind as existent in his time on the Tigris and
Euphrates; similar skiffs are used on those rivers at the present
day; boats of analogous construction are employed in some parts
of India; they are propelled by paddles where the water is deep,
and poled over the shallows. Nothing can be more simple than
the construction of these skiffs; only two materials are requisite,
and they the most accessible in the country, <i>i.e.</i> bamboo and hides.
When Cæsar had constructed boats in Spain, after the manner
learnt by him in Britain, it is said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> “the keels and ribs were
made of light timber, the rest of the hull being woven together with
basket-work, and covered with hides.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<div class="verse">…</div>
<div class="verse">On such to neighbouring Gaul, allured by gain,</div>
<div class="verse">The bolder Britons cross the swelling main.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Pliny says:&mdash;“Even now, in the British channel, they (the boats)
are made of osiers, covered with hides sewn together.” Solinus,
describing the rough sea between Britain and Ireland, says that
the natives “sail in ships made of osiers, which they surround with
a covering of hides.” Adamnan, in his life of St. Columba, refers to
a voyage made in a curach by St. Cormac. The curach is said to
be still in use on the Severn,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and on some parts of the coast of
Ireland, in shape and build similar to those of thousands of years
ago; at the same time it may be affirmed that few persons of the
present generation could declare they have seen the <i>true</i> curach,
that term having been now transferred to boats covered with coarse
tarred canvas, and which differ widely both in form and method of
construction from their ancient prototype. The curach seen by W.
F. Wakeman in use on the river Boyne so late as the year 1848 is
thus described by him:&mdash;A regular frame of willow ribs, generally
laid in pairs, and extending along the sides and floor, formed the
skeleton of the future boat, which was in the form of the bowl of a
spoon, a little broader towards one end than the other; about eight
feet in length, but very nearly circular. The extremities of the
ribs for a depth of about eighteen inches from what would now be
called the gunwale, were set in a very thick, strong, and closely-woven
band of wicker-work, above which the ends of the rods
slightly projected. Midships was a thwart of ash or oak pierced
with four holes, two near either end, through which were rove
thongs, composed of twisted osiers connecting the seat, or thwart,
with various portions of the above mentioned band, so as to bind
the work together. The frame was then covered over on the outside
with skin, untanned, of the horse or cow; and the result was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
completion of a boat well adapted for the requirements of fishermen.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
The raw hide of a newly slain animal, properly extended
presented a ready means of constructing a boat, and became to the
early inhabitants of the British Islands what the birch-tree bark is
to the American Indian. In the sculptures from Nineveh a similar
use of the hide is observed, as a means of crossing rivers, but the
application is less ingenious, being merely a skin inflated with air
like what is called on some parts of the Irish coast a “stookey,”
and with which, not unfrequently, fishermen, so late as the year
1860, floated their nets and lines; the skin of a dog or any other
animal served the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p><i>Ingenuity of Lake Dwellers, Clothing, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;It has been remarked
that the brains of most savages and the skulls of most
primitive races are larger than, in theory, they ought to be;
often rather larger than the brains and skulls of the average
masses of the great cities of the present day; but this need
not cause surprise, if the life of intelligent interest passed by
the savage child be taken into consideration. From the tenderest
age he was observant of all the devices practised by his
parents for procuring clothing, food, means of defence, in
short, all the essentials of existence; the natural result of his
wild life was health and strength; indeed, on the principle
of the survival of the fittest, it could only be the robust who lived
through the hardships and climatic exposure incidental to a savage
life. The lake dweller was no exception to this rule, for his ingenuity
would be most fully exercised in endeavouring to procure
the means of sustenance for his family. It is easy to imagine
the various daily occupations needful in his struggles for existence.
Timber from the forest supplied him with materials
both for his dwelling and for fuel; the skins of wild animals
furnished him with clothing, he shaped them with a sharp flint
flake, and sewed them with thongs, using as needle the pierced
bone of some bird or small mammal. In early Irish history
mention occurs of skin or leather garments: when <i>Muircheartach
MacNeill</i> made his celebrated circuit of Ireland, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 942,
it is stated that his soldiers were clad in long leather cloaks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
We are not left to mere conjecture regarding the manner in
which the men of these primitive times protected themselves
from the inclemency of the weather. In the year 1821 the
body of a man, about six feet in height, with dark, reddish-coloured
hair, short beard, and teeth in a good state of preservation,
was found ten feet below the surface of a bog, on the lands of
Gallagh, near Castle Blakeney, county Galway. The head, legs,
and feet were bare, but the body was covered with a deer-skin tunic
reaching to the knees and half-way down the arms; in front it
was laced and fastened by thongs of the same material. The mantle
was, unfortunately, much injured in the disinterment, but a few
fragments of it still hung together; portions of the seams sewed
with fine gut of three strands still remained;
“the regularity and closeness
of the stitches are most remarkable, as
shown by the accompanying cut, in
which a portion of one of the joinings
is represented double the natural size.
This closure was effected by what is
termed the looped stitch, similar to that
used in working a button-hole, so that by having each stitch
knotted the chance of ripping was lessened.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The age of the
Irish mummy (if we may apply that term to the body here described)
is considered by some to date back at least 2000 years.</p>

<p>A bed of growing peat is endowed with marvellous powers. It
seems to act like the ancient Egyptian process of embalming on the
bodies of men or animals that have become accidentally entombed
in it, preserving them for centuries after their contemporaries have,
by the ordinary laws of nature, totally disappeared, and organic
substances, such as butter, seem also to feel its influence. Peat may
bear comparison with ice, the well-known preservative properties of
which were strikingly illustrated by the discovery on the shores of
Lake Oncoul, in Siberia, of a carcass of the <i>Elephas primigenius</i>, or
mammoth (supposed to have become extinct in the Pleistocene
period) in a perfect state, and so well refrigerated that, when
thawed, the dogs of the neighbourhood devoured its flesh. Again,
in 1846, the summer in Siberia had been unusually hot; the frozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
marshes which extend along each side of the river Indigirka were
thawed, and a perfectly preserved carcass of a mammoth floated
down the stream. This monster had most probably met his death
centuries before by sinking into the deep snow of the morasses, was
frozen over, and thus remained until the exceptional summer heat
melted his icy prison.</p>

<p><a name="STONE_BRONZE_AND_IRON_AGES" id="STONE_BRONZE_AND_IRON_AGES"></a><i>Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages.</i>&mdash;We know that the learned have
divided the period man has inhabited the globe into what may
roughly be called three Ages&mdash;the Stone, the Bronze, and the Iron.
Ancient mythology presented us with another, ycleped the Golden,
when our planet was supposed to be a paradise, and man lived in a
state of perpetual happiness; it is to be feared that the idea of a
golden age, either past or to come, is purely mythical. Future
archæologists may, perhaps, be tempted to apply the designation
“Steel” to the present or now commencing epoch, in order to
distinguish it from the mere “Iron Age.” Improved methods of
manufacture are now-a-days causing steel in some degree to supersede
its parent metal, iron, even as iron superseded bronze. Excavations
on the site of crannogs have demonstrated clearly the fact that
some of them have had a continuous existence throughout the three
ages of Stone, Bronze, and Iron. Classification of the earth’s
history into those three ages does not, however, imply a defined
and distinctive period when stone, bronze, or iron alone was in
exclusive use, though there may possibly have been a time in
which only stone and bone were available. When the empires of
the Tigris and Nile were in their prime, the northern littoral of
Europe was inhabited by a race using implements of bone and stone,
but these regions were in the Bronze Age<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> at the period when the
Phœnicians had attained the zenith of their power. According
to some writers, the inhabitants of the Baltic littoral had not till
early in the Christian era discarded bronze and stone for iron. Although
weapons of bone or flint were certainly of an earlier age than
bronze and iron, yet it is more than probable that flint, bronze, and
iron may have been in use at one and the same period, and even in
the same locality, down to a period long subsequent to the Christian
era. To this day the Esquimaux use bone implements, but they also
employ iron, so that in remote countries a stone age might be said
still to exist, the few iron implements in possession of the wild tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
being acquired by recent contact with western civilization. In Ireland
there is no fixed line of demarcation between the stone, the
bronze, and the iron age; there was an overlapping and co-mingling
as the better and more useful metal gradually superseded its predecessor.
Thus a stone instrument, by itself, would be a most deceptive
guide in determining the state of civilization of the inhabitants of
the site on which it was discovered, because stone implements are
also found associated with articles both of bronze and iron. “Like
the three principal colours of the rainbow,” writes Mr. Evans, “these
three stages of civilization overlap, intermingle, and shade off, the
one into the other; and yet their succession, as far as Western
Europe is concerned, appears to be equally well defined with that of
the prismatic colours, though the proportions of the spectrum may
vary in different countries.” Petrie, the well-known Irish antiquary,
was the first to claim for a large class of iron remains the position
of an interesting connecting link, which they are now allowed
to hold, between the bronze manufacture of a remote age and the
industrial achievements of comparatively modern days. At the
period of the first discovery of the remains of Irish lake dwellings,
archæologists looked upon objects of iron found in lakes, or in their
immediate vicinity, with very little interest, for it was considered
that they could not have held out against the corroding influence of
water for a lengthened period; therefore iron was supposed to stamp
lacustrine habitations with a mediæval or even modern impress.
The belief was then very general that the inhabitants of Erin of
the prehistoric period, having existed generation after generation
as manufacturers of flint and stone weapons, had gradually, through
some unknown channel, become acquainted with gold, silver, and
bronze, and that this latter metal, down even to the advent of St.
Patrick, was used almost exclusively in the manufacture of weapons
of war, small ornaments for personal adornment, and objects of
domestic use. Articles of stone, bone, wood, bronze, and iron have
been discovered in strange medley: swords, spear and javelin heads,
axes, daggers, knives, hones, querns, shears, tweezers, chains, combs,
pins, brooches, beads, horse trappings, cauldrons of hammered
bronze, lumps of iron slag, &amp;c.&mdash;in short, every conceivable object,
from the rudest flint implement to highly-finished silver ornaments.</p>

<p>The accidental discovery of the great historical crannog of Lagore,
in the county Meath, already referred to, presents the first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and probably the most important, treasure-trove of earliest iron
implements. In <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 848 an Irish chief, with his Danish allies,
plundered this island fortress and burnt it; whilst in 933, nearly a
century later, the place again suffered a similar fate at the hands of
another marauder. Nothing more was heard of it till the date of its
disinterment, about the year 1840. The latest period, therefore, to
which the majority of the antiquities so plentifully found within
and around this stronghold may be referred, is somewhere between
the eleventh and earliest half of the tenth century. This approximate
date is about the historic limit in which the so-called “Iron
Age” may be allowed to have reached back in Ireland. How long it
had previously existed there must be matter of conjecture; but it is
almost incredible that its natives should have been far behind their
neighbours in the art of metallurgy; and we know that Cæsar<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
found the Britons acquainted with the use of iron. It can only be
surmised that, at some very remote period, bronze as the prevailing
material gave way to iron, but the period of transition may probably
be counted by centuries.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><i>Weapons and Tools.</i>&mdash;In nearly all Irish crannogs, more especially
in the larger sites, weapons of war and of the chase have
been discovered in abundance, consisting chiefly of arrow- and
spear-heads, swords, daggers or skeans, knives, and axe-heads.
The numerous fragments of artificially fashioned bone found in
and around crannogs plainly demonstrate how much that material
was utilized by their inhabitants; many tips of the antlers of
deer contained in the collection of the Royal Irish Academy and
in that of the Royal Historical and Archæological Association, have
evidently been sawn from the original branches, and employed in
forming handles for swords, knives and daggers; some are ornamented,
whilst others are pierced with a hole at one extremity,
having evidently been fabricated for a distinct purpose, for spear- or
javelin-heads, &amp;c.; these were attached to handles or shafts,
by means of the sinews of animals, or thongs of skin. Amongst
primitive races the transition from tool to weapon is slight; the
same article must, in many cases, have served the double purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Arrow- or spear-heads have been found of bone, horn, flint,
bronze, and iron; they are usually of small size. Figs. <a href="#fig012">12</a> and <a href="#fig013">13</a>,
from Lough Ravel, county Antrim, represent (half-size) flakes
fashioned into arrow- or spear-heads. <a href="#fig014">Fig. 14</a> is a flake of basalt

<p><a href="#plate06">Plate <span class="smcapuc">VI.</span></a>, No. 1 is a flint implement,
probably a knife. No. 2&mdash;A well-worked
flint, most likely used for the same purpose.
No. 3&mdash;A flint “scraper,” that appears to
be somewhat injured at one end. No. 4
represents what antiquaries style a “core”
of flint. It is in fact the remains of a
block, from which flakes have been struck
for the purpose of forming them into arrow-heads,
knives, &amp;c., &amp;c. No. 5 is a specimen
of the hammer-stone so frequently discovered
in the refuse heaps of Irish crannogs.
They are usually abraded at the extremities,
as if from long use, and similar articles occur in the shell mounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of our coasts, having probably been used for breaking crustaceæ.
No. 6 is an ordinary stone hatchet. No. 7 represents a wooden
object which has all the appearance of having been used as the
handle of a stone-hatchet. It is here given ⅛ of the real
size. The aperture, supposed to have been made for the reception
of a stone celt, measures in length, 3⅜ in., but the
shrinking of the wood in drying renders it impossible to say
what its original breadth may have been. The dotted line is introduced
to show how the cutting instrument was most probably
placed. No. 8 may have been either a dagger or a spear-head;
it is of bone; a rivet-hole indicates that a handle was at one time
attached. No. 9&mdash;A knife of bone, the handle and blade in one
piece. It measures 8 in. in length, and the haft portion, as
shown in the illustration, is ornamented with a series of squares
enclosing a rude pattern composed of dots. No. 10 is a very
curious little article formed of bone, and not untastefully decorated
in the same style as the socket portion of the iron spear-head, as
shown in <a href="#plate09">plate <span class="smcapuc">IX.</span></a>, fig. 6. It was evidently a scoop, and would be
serviceable in the extraction of marrow from
bones of deer, or other animals used as food
by the lake dwellers. Nos. 11 and 12 are rude
unornamented knives, in a single piece each.
It is not easy to guess what articles of this
kind could have been employed to cut, but so
early as the times of stone chambers, knives of
bone were in requisition.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

but both spear-heads and daggers formed of bone have been found
at Ardakillen, Ballinderry, and other crannogs. In the Swiss

of horn, the cutting portion being flint or stone, inserted

<p>Swords, whether of bronze or iron, are almost invariably of
small size, and double edged. There is usually a central rib to
the blade, but in some instances fluting occurs. The ordinary
crannog sword may be described generally as of two kinds, the
one increasing in breadth from the handle to the end, which
terminates in the form of a triangle; the other is shorter, with a
broad straight-edged blade obtusely pointed. Their handles were
composed of bone or horn, and sometimes wood was used. There
was no hilt or guard, properly speaking, though the handle
usually somewhat overlaps the edges of the blade, while it recedes
in a curve tending in a direction opposite to that of the pommel.</p>

<p>In April, 1864, a sword-blade of bronze, with the haft still
attached, was found adjoining a lake containing a small artificial
island, in the townland of Galbally, county Tyrone. The extreme
length of blade, 25 in.; breadth at tang, 1¾ in.; weight, 13¾
ounces. The handle (both sides of which are represented in the
accompanying plate) is of bone, probably cetacean; its length, 3½
inches; weight 1 ounce; thickness, ⅝ of an inch. The smallness
of the handle is very remarkable, taking into consideration the
popular idea of the great stature and strength of Erin’s ancient
inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> A well-preserved iron sword, with bronze mountings
to the handle, was found in the crannog of Lisnacroghera.
The blade tapers gradually to a point from about midway down
its length, with a central ridge. The bronze mountings of the
sword-handle are four in number. “Of these, one is at the
pommel, another hoods as it were the butt of the blade, two others
are intermediate, and very probably do not now occupy their
original position, one of them certainly being movable. It is,
therefore, impossible to judge of the space which had been left
for reception of the swordsman’s hand. It may be observed that
the edges of all these fittings had been serrated or milled, but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>

somewhat resembles an oriental weapon,
the blade being curved towards
the point; the length is 13¼ in., width
1 in., and the curved portion alone has
a cutting edge. No. 4 is a peculiar,
single-edged weapon of diminutive
size; the blade measures 8 in., and the
entire length is only 13 in., including
the cross ornamented socket into which
the haft was fixed.</p>

<p>With these articles an iron ring
was found (5) having a portion of
chain still attached; it is seemingly
part of a manacle. In ancient Irish
writings mention is made of “golden”
fetters, and no doubt the “golden”
swords,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> also noticed in old poems as
having been used by the Dalcassians,

<p>No. 1, <a href="#plate09">plate <span class="smcapuc">IX.</span></a>, is an iron sword, with bronze mounting at
handle, measuring 25¾ in. in length; the breadth of blade is
1½ in.; and the handle 3½ in. long. This was considered by
Petrie to be the finest specimen of its class then found. No. 2
may be also considered a very characteristic specimen of the
ordinary crannog sword; its length is 23 in. including the handle,
which measures 4 in. No. 3 exhibits a beautifully executed
bronze fitting which separated the handle from the blade; the
ornamentation of the bronze is a fine specimen of the “trumpet
pattern.” The total length is 21½ in. No. 4 is characteristic of
the shorter crannog sword or dagger; total length 14¼ in.</p>

</div>

<p>Few darts or spear-heads have been found of bronze, but the
iron examples are very numerous, often of beautiful form and
highly ornamented; they vary in length from about 6 to 18
inches. No. 5 represents a spear-head of iron in a wonderful
state of preservation, and retaining two rivets, by which it was
attached to the handle. The socket is ornamented with an
elegant pattern in lines obliquely crossing each other, but the
work is too fine to admit of being properly shown on the scale here
given; length 13⅛ in. No. 6. A spear-head, its socket strengthened
by two bronze ferrules, is very curiously ornamented with a
number of small crosses, separated from each other by fillets;
there are apertures for four rivets which do not now remain;
possibly they were of wood; length 14½ in. No. 7. A spear-head,
interesting on account of the ornamentation on its socket,
as also from its general <i>contour</i>, which resembles that of some of
the finest known bronze examples; length 13⅛ in. No. 8. An
extremely slender spear-head from Ballinderry, where it was
found with a good many others; length 16 in. No. 9. A spear-
or javelin-head; the form is very slender: entire length 9 in.
No. 10 is a well-preserved and interesting axe-head of iron, its
cutting edge well steeled. It measures 4½ in. at the edge, and
3¾ in. from edge to back. Axe-heads of this peculiar form are to
be seen in Scotland, sculptured on early monumental stones, probably
of the Pictish age. No. 11 is an axe-head of the form most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
commonly found in Irish crannogs; it measures 7 in. in length.
No. 12 was found with the last described; it measures 7½ in.
This form of axe-head, although of rather rare occurrence in
Ireland, is common on the Continent. No. 13 is an iron dagger,
no doubt in use contemporaneously with the swords just noticed.
The handle is of bone or horn, and it is valuable as an illustration
of the style of hafting early iron weapons of the sword and dagger
class. No. 14 is a point formed of iron, and containing a socket.
It was most likely an arrow-head. No. 15 is a very beautifully
formed arrow-head from Lough Gur; length 3¼ in. From the
size of the socket the shaft must have been extremely slender.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
Arrow-heads of this kind are rare in Irish crannogs.</p>

<p class="caption">Spear Butt-ends of Bronze from Lisnacroghera.
Two-thirds natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>The two spear-heads from Lagore, (<a href="#fig018">fig. 18</a>), are in fine preservation
and very sharp; their length 10 in. In the crannog of
Lisnacroghera, a magnificent spear-head
of iron was discovered, of which a front
and side view (half-size) is given, <a href="#plate10">plate <span class="smcapuc">X</span></a>.
Spear-heads of this class have been commonly
met with in the larger lacustrine
sites, but this specimen is invested with a
peculiar interest, from its being found in
company with a number of bronze objects,
whose use up to the present was unknown
to antiquarians. It is now certain they were
the butt-ends of spear-shafts&mdash;indeed two
were discovered with the ends of their
shafts still remaining in them. The mode
in which one&mdash;and probably others also&mdash;had
been attached to the handle is thus
described by Canon Greenwell:&mdash;“The
end of the shaft is split, and into the
split is inserted a wedge of iron, so that
when driven home, the wedge expanded
the end of the shaft, and kept it firm in the butt.” In Anderson’s
<i>Scotland in Pre-historic Times</i> one is described as having
been found in Orkney. Like its Lisnacroghera fellows, it differs
from the generality of Irish remains of its class, in the possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of a rich moulding bisecting the neck, but in all other
particulars the style is identical. All the specimens of this class
here figured were obtained by Canon Grainger from the crannog
of Lisnacroghera. To one
bronze butt was attached
the whole of the shaft, 8
feet in length, furnished at
top with a beautifully designed
loop of bronze (see
<a href="#plate11">plate <span class="smcapuc">XI</span></a>), and upon it was
displayed a perfect Greek
fret, with provision for the
reception of enamel. From
the same locality was procured
also the highly interesting
fragment which
forms the central object of
<a href="#plate11">plate <span class="smcapuc">XI</span></a>. It is portion of
a spear-shaft retaining its
bronze ferrule, and the rivet,
also of bronze, by which the
head was secured; this
band or ferrule, being exceptionally
beautiful, has
been drawn as if rolled out.
Adjoining the edges are
slightly projecting fillets,
enclosing a space through
which runs a graceful wavy
pattern in relief. The
hollows were doubtless enamelled,
as in the case of
similar ornamentation on
some bronze remains in the
same “find.” The space
between the fillets or bands
is occupied by a singular
design, and this design, all but the circular bosses, four in number,
may be described as in low relief. The intervening spaces, like
those of the fillets above and below, at one time contained coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
enamel. Altogether the style of this object represents as it were a
combination of classic and Celtic ornamentation. The smaller and
even more classic-looking ferrule to the left of <a href="#plate11">plate <span class="smcapuc">XI.</span></a> has already
been noticed (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_64">64</a>); the figure to the right (<a href="#plate11">plate <span class="smcapuc">XI.</span></a>)
represents a bronze rivet of curious form, with well-sunk depressions
on one of its sides, like those seen on a cog-wheel.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The distinguishing characteristic of the bronze dagger or skean
from Lagore (<a href="#fig024">fig. 24</a>) consists
in its openwork handle forming
one piece with the blade. The
weapon is 9¾ inches in length;
the handle, 3⅛. The blade, 1⅜
inches in width, is flat, with broad
bevelled edges. <a href="#fig025">Fig. 25</a>, found at
Loughran Island, in the Lower
Bann, is 4⅞ inches in length by
1¾ in width. It is a thin, flat,
angular-shaped dagger blade,
decorated on the surface of the
mid-rib with a series of dotted lines, and pierced at the broad end
by four small rivet-holes.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Daggers or skeans of bone, as well
as of bronze and iron, have been frequently found in Irish lake
dwellings, and knives formed of flint are not uncommon. The
iron knives found in the crannog of Ballinderry, and now in
the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy, resembled those figured
in Munro’s <i>Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings</i>.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>At the time the Catalogue of the Museum of the Royal Irish
Academy was compiled by the late Sir W. Wilde, although some
objects of bronze, supposed to have been ornaments on leather or
wooden dagger sheaths, are mentioned by him, yet he was unable
to point to any example composed altogether of bronze. Since
that period, however, three sword-sheaths of that metal have been
discovered in the crannog of Lisnacroghera, county Antrim. Their
workmanship is exquisite. They bear traces of enamel, and one of
them contained a sword of iron so firmly attached to it by corrugation
that any attempt to withdraw it must have involved the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
mutilation or utter destruction of the bronze in which it was
encased.</p>

<p>The decoration of the sheath, <a href="#plate12">plate <span class="smcapuc">XII</span>, No. 2</a>, is very remarkable;
the distinctive peculiarity being its spiral character, a perfect specimen
of those combinations of involved circles and curvilinear lines,
supposed to be characteristic of early Celtic art. Some portions of
the sheath, near its end, still retain settings in enamel, the colour of
which, though now faded, must have been rich vermillion. Enamel
of the same hue and material once occupied the little saucer-like
depressions which occur on the terminating snake-suggesting head.
One of the circles (that had been, doubtless, intended to represent
eyes) shows that it had been so filled, as were, probably, the little
raised bosses, two in number, that may be observed at the opposite
extremity. The interior of what might be styled the crescent-shaped
patterns, nine in number, which occupy the chief plane of
the sheath, as also the minor spirals of their adjacent spaces in the
general figure, exhibit a design suggestive of basket-work. It is
now impossible to determine whether the sheaths had been formed
by casting, or were beaten into shape from a plain sheet of copper.
It is evident that for the production of the ornamentation a graver
had been used. The lines are sharply and deeply incised, and
appear to have been intended for the reception of enamel of a
black shade, some traces of which appear here and there. The
enamel on the sheath “was, in all probability, <i>niello</i>, a composition
of silver, copper, sulphur, and lead, the <i>nigellum</i> of ancient writers.
It was not so hard or lasting as the ordinary enamel of glass
or vitrified paste, some examples of which may be seen on several
early ecclesiastical remains. The art of enamelling in <i>niello</i> is
of the very highest antiquity; it was practised by the Egyptians.
Specimens of it, of various ages, even of modern times, are
numerous, and it appears to have been known to the Anglo-Saxons,
as a ring of Bishop Ethelwulf (ninth century) is ornamented
with it.”</p>

<p>Although the decoration of the third sheath is similar in style,
yet some of its features are peculiar, especially the dot and circle
pattern along one of the edges, and which appears to have extended
from handle to extremity.</p>

<p>In a small lake called
Cornagall (<i>the Hillock of the
Dane or Stranger</i>), about six miles from Cavan, there is an almost
circular artificial island, thirty yards in diameter, its crannog nature,
attested by rows of oaken stakes fencing its margin, showing
above the summer level of the lake. In August, 1869, the water
being then particularly low, a log of timber that bore evident traces
of manual labour was ascertained to be the end of a “dug-out”
embedded in soft, boggy matter. It proved, however, to be only
a fragment, the other portion having been destroyed by fire, as
evinced by the charred appearance of the remains: the large quantity
of charcoal, half consumed sticks and chips visible on the margin
of the crannog indicated its destruction also by that element.
A set of iron tools lay on the floor of the canoe thus discovered, all
here represented one-third their real size. The following is a brief
description of them:&mdash;</p>

<p><a href="#plate13">Plate <span class="smcapuc">XIII.</span>, No. 1</a>, is an adze in a perfect state: the metallic portion
consists of soft iron, well steeled to a considerable distance from its
cutting edge. <a href="#plate13">No. 2</a> is an adze, scraper, or implement of the same
class, but differing from the former in that it shows no perforation;
its narrow-pointed end had evidently been intended for insertion
in a wooden handle: the edge being broken, it is impossible to
determine whether it had been steeled. <a href="#plate13">No. 3</a> is a hammer of iron,
the handle of oak, split at its upper extremity for the insertion of a
wedge, which still remains. <a href="#plate13">No. 4</a> is a celt or chisel&mdash;a somewhat
similar object (from Lagore), but considerably broader, is preserved
in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy. <a href="#plate13">Nos. 5 and 6</a> represent
a thin, knife-like piece of iron and a wooden handle,
originally, perhaps, portions of one implement; the wood, hollowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
for reception of the blade, is perforated for the insertion of a rivet,
which no longer remains. With the iron tools in the canoe was

the uppermost, probably a knife, and having a hole through what
appears to have been the haft end. The other two articles are
said to be the remains of a saw, and the long fragment, perforated
in four places, is supposed to be the strengthening bar attached to
the piece of wood into which the back of the saw had been inserted.</p>

<p><i>Hones.</i>&mdash;Hones and sharpening stones are very commonly met
with in crannogs; they plainly denote that at some period during
their habitable existence the occupiers possessed metallic weapons
or tools. The Cornagall “find”

one is given (<a href="#plate13">plate XIII.

in colour, almost black, extremely hard, and close-grained; they

<p><i>Armour.</i>&mdash;Amongst crannog “finds” no well-authenticated
remains of defensive armour have been recorded, with the exception
of a fragment of chain armour from Inisrush, and the
ancient “golden bronze” shield from Lough Gur. The armour
found on the site of the crannog in Lough Annagh is not here
taken into consideration, it being evidently seventeenth century
work.</p>

<p>In the townland of Monea, about five miles from Enniskillen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
county Fermanagh, in a small but deep lake,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> there is a very fine
circular crannog, about seventy-five feet in diameter, composed
almost entirely of timber, and surrounded with remains of staking;
a complete examination of the site was not possible, owing to the
thick mass of roots and fibres thrown out by the trees with which
it was studded. Upon digging into that portion of the shore
offering the greatest facility, there were discovered several fragments
of bones of the <i>Bos longifrons</i> and other animals, quantities
of charcoal, some iron slag, and the remains of the curious iron
helmet here figured, which must, however, be viewed as of comparatively
modern date. The helmet is entirely devoid of ornamentation,
is acutely conical in shape, and no traces of nasal or
cheek pieces remain. A casque, very similar to this, was found in
the river Nore, near Borris-in-Ossory, Queen’s County, and is
preserved in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy.</p>

<p class="caption">Front View of Bronze Shield from Lough Gur. Diameter 28 inches.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>The shield, of which the accompanying plate gives a correct
representation, was found in the bog close to the banks of Lough
Gur, County Limerick; and near it were the head and antlers
of a <i>Megaceros Hibernicus</i>. This shield is a disc of bronze,
slightly convex, and strengthened by a series of six concentric circles
formed of hollow bosses, about two hundred in number, surrounding
the central umbo. It appears to have been carried slung on
the shoulder, the slinging loops being fixed so as to form bosses on
the obverse equal in size to those contained in the circle: it was
furnished with a very small handle, interiorly traversing the umbo.
The rim is an inch three-quarters in width; the diameter, two feet
three and three-quarter inches. The holes with which the shield
is pierced are not proofs of warfare; it was the discoverer&mdash;a boy
with a fishing gaff&mdash;who inflicted the injuries in bringing his novel
spoil to land.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The Rev. James Graves considered the looseness
of the rivets at the inside loops for the strap by which the shield
was carried, to be proof that some material, most probably the
hide of an animal, had originally formed an inner lining, as the
thin bronze being in itself incapable of withstanding the impact of a
fishing-gaff, could afford little real protection against even ordinary
weapons of warfare. The coating of sheet bronze may be viewed
rather as ornamentation than as rendering the shield more impenetrable;
or it may have been but a variety of the arrangement
of studs or circles of bronze affixed to bucklers of wood or
leather&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Museum of Antiquities at Edinburgh may be seen a
bronze shield of like character.</p>

<p>In the Crannog of Lisnacroghera was discovered, with many
warlike weapons, a disc of thin bronze, its centre from one-third
its circumference descending into a hollow, at the base of which
is an aperture: the ornamented side, as here portrayed, must
have been intended to be the front, as the other side is quite plain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
“Can it be the centre of a shield, other portions of which were composed
of less durable materials? Certain it is, that thin circular
plates of bronze, displaying
similar depressions, have
been found both in England
and in Ireland, and are supposed
to be connected with
the mounting of shields.”</p>

<p><a name="FOOD_AND_VEGETABLE_REMAINS" id="FOOD_AND_VEGETABLE_REMAINS"></a><i>Vegetable Remains.</i>&mdash;The ancient Irish set
great value upon the hazel plant, a fact demonstrated
by the frequent mention made of it in
their best and oldest <span class="smcapuc">MSS.</span>; the numerous round
stones met with in crannogs are supposed to have
been used for breaking the nuts; their shells form
the most considerable portion of vegetable remains
in the kitchen middens, where beech nuts also are
present; and it is known that within historic times
the Irish kept large herds of swine that fed on masts in the woods,
for then</p>

<p><i>Hammer-stones.</i>&mdash;It cannot be doubted that in a few instances
the round stones, sometimes designated “sling-stones,” have been
artificially worked, but the great majority must be looked upon
simply as water-worn pebbles that had been utilized as hammer-stones.
Many of the egg-shaped specimens are more or less frayed
or chipped at their extremities; and similar stones, used, as is supposed,
for breaking crustacea, are common in the “shell mounds”
on the coast, as also amongst the “kitchen middens” of ancient
settlements that abound within the sand dunes of the north-western
littoral of Ireland. A large flat stone implement, with
circular termination, rough sides, and polished edges, was found in
the crannog of “The Miracles,” county Fermanagh. It measured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
about eleven inches by three, and was one inch thick. Its flat
end shows marks of wear, as if used for a pounding
instrument. A stone exactly similar was
found in a “kitchen midden” at Ardnahue,
county Carlow, which had all the appearance of
having been grasped in the hand for use, hence
the edges polished from constant friction.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Bones of the red deer (<i>Cervus elephas</i>) are extremely plentiful
in lacustrine sites. It is the wild animal most frequently mentioned
in early Irish history, and of which there were many until a comparatively
modern epoch: so late as 1752 they abounded in
the barony of Erris, county Mayo, and some few exist still in
Killarney. The head and antlers here shown came from the
crannog of Ballinderry, county Westmeath. The horns in this
specimen are still attached to the cranium, and there were originally
seven tines on the right, and eight on the left side. Bones of the
<i>Magaceros Hibernicus</i>, or Irish big-horn, of the wolf and fox, of a
small breed of horse, and of the ass, have been also met with. The
remains of sheep belong to the horned class. There are several
specimens of the four-horned variety of the goat (<a href="#fig042">fig. 42</a>), but
those of the ordinary kind are more numerous: figs. <a href="#fig040">40</a> and <a href="#fig041">41</a> are
from Dunshaughlin. Amongst the vast collection
of animal remains on the site of this crannog
were heads of canine animals: of the largest
of these the accompanying cut gives a faithful
representation. “It is nearly eleven inches in
length, measured from the end of the occipital
ridge to the alveolar process at the roots of the
upper incisors, and is principally characterized
by the magnitude of the crest.”<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The profile view
of the outline, and the prolonged muzzle, rather
lead to the belief of its having belonged to the
true Irish wolf-dog of former times, a large long-coated
hound, of an iron-grey colour.</p>

<p>According to the best authorities, there were in Europe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
early times four great types of oxen: first, the <i>Bos priscus</i>, or
Urus, the great Auroch, that even in classic times roamed through
the forests of Germany; and its bones have been found in Swiss
lacustrine sites: it was of great size, had long upright horns, a
narrow forehead, high frontal crest, projecting orbits, and a warm
shaggy coat, reddish-brown in colour. The second type, the <i>Bos
primigenus</i>, was found by the Romans amongst the wilds of
Europe; it had long, slightly-curved horns, set on at right angles
to the head, but turning forward at the extremities, and spreading
to a breadth of nearly five feet from tip to tip. The third
variety, the <i>Bos trochocerus</i> had a very narrow head, and long
cylindrical horn-cores rising high above the level of the back of
the occiput, then curving forwards and inwards. The fourth
type, which is almost peculiar to Ireland, has been denominated
<i>Bos longifrons</i>, the long-fronted or small fossil ox&mdash;somewhat of
a misnomer it must be confessed, because, properly speaking, it
should be denominated <i>Bos latifrons</i>, from the exceeding breadth
of forehead and face, in which particular it differs in an especial
manner from the three former.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Specimens of the crania of four distinct breeds of cattle from
crannogs are here given as described by Wilde, who named them
very appositely: 1, the straight-horn, or <i>Drom-adharach</i>; 2, the
crumpled-horn, or <i>Crom-adharach</i>; 3, the short-horn, or <i>Gearr-adharach</i>;
4, the Hornless, or <i>Maol</i>. Of the first type (<a href="#fig044">Fig. 44</a>),
which was found at Dunshaughlin, Wilde states that there are
none now existing in Ireland of this race, evidently domesticated
descendants of the ancient wild <i>Bos longifrons</i>. The cranium is
“broad in the face, flat on the forehead, nearly level between the
horns, with but slight projecting orbits, short thick slugs or horn-cores
rising but little above the occipital crest, and turning slightly
inwards, like some of the best short-horned bulls of the present day.
It is eighteen inches long in the face, and nineteen from tip to tip
of horn-core.”</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig045">Fig. 45</a> represents a cranium of the <i>Crom-adharach</i> or Crumpled-horn,
which, judging by its remains, appears to have been the
most numerous variety. This magnificent head of a bull of
the race is “in point of size as fine a specimen as has yet been
found: it is twenty-three and a-half inches long, and eight inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
across the forehead, which has been broken in by some blunt instrument,
probably in slaughtering. The horn-cores are not so
large at the base, but more than twice as long as those of the
“straight-horned” race; they are curved considerably inwards, so
that the tips of the horns, when perfect, must have approached
much nearer than their bases. Each horn-core was, when perfect,
about eleven inches long.” This head, together with many similar
crania, came from the crannog of Lough Gur, county Limerick.</p>

<p>The third class, or “short-horn”, had long narrow faces,
with exceedingly small horn-cores curving abruptly inwards. The
cranium of one specimen (female) measured seventeen inches
in length of face, six inches across the forehead, and eleven inches
from tip to tip of horn-core. <a href="#fig046">Fig. 46</a> gives a good illustration
of this breed, which was abundant. The fourth class, the <i>Maol</i>,
or Myleen (the hornless or bald), differs in nothing from those
of the present day, save that it appears to have been of smaller
size than its modern representative. The average length of face
is about seventeen inches, by about eight inches across the orbits.
Almost all the heads of this variety presented by Wilde to the
R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A. came from the crannog of Dunshaughlin: they exhibit
a remarkable protuberance or frontal crest.</p>

<p>In Switzerland, at Robenhausen, a settlement of the Stone Age
which had been buried under a bed of peat, it is stated by
Keller that horizontal layers were discovered of a foreign substance,
from two to ten inches thick, ascertained on analysis to
be composed of the fæces of cattle. May not some of the
dark strata on crannogs be composed of like matter? for there
is documentary evidence that the Irish chiefs kept cattle on
their islands in time of war. The Lord Treasurer Winchester,
writing to announce the decease of Shane O’Neill to the Lord
Deputy, says, that “he ought to inspect Shane’s lodging in
the fen, where he built his abode, and <i>kept his cattle</i> and all
his men,” &amp;c., &amp;c. This “abode” is known to have been a
crannog.</p>

<p><i>Butter.</i>&mdash;The custom of burying or hiding butter in bogs is
probably of very ancient origin, but, like many old customs, was
carried down in Ireland to a very late period. Thomas Dineley,
in a diary of his visit to Ireland in the reign of Charles II., states
that the Irish used “Butter layd up in wicker basketts, mixed with
store of … a sort of garlick, and buried for some time in a
bog.” Sir William Petty mentions “butter made rancid by keeping
in bogs.” The custom is thus described in the Irish <i>Hudibras</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Butter to eat with their hog</div>
<div class="verse">Was seven years buried in bog.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Faröe islanders had a similar practice with regard to
tallow. Bog butter, or mineral tallow, is usually met with in
single-piece wooden vessels, like long firkins.</p>

<p><i>Yokes.</i>&mdash;For beasts of burden, the yoke was in use from the
earliest ages, but any that have been hitherto discovered, whether
double or single, appear too small for cattle of species still existent;
however, the old race of domesticated kine in Ireland may have
been smaller in size than those of the present day. Probably the
first yoke that attracted notice was the one described and illustrated
by Wilde in his Catalogue of the Museum of the Royal
Irish Academy, for it was not until a comparatively late period
that the attention of antiquaries was directed towards this class of
remains, usually found covered by a considerable depth of bog.
A good idea of their general appearance is conveyed by the accompanying
illustrations (<a href="#plate16">plate <span class="smcapuc">XVI.</span></a>) representing two yokes of wood
that were discovered under eighteen feet of peat in Donagh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>

<p><i>Piscatory Implements.</i>&mdash;In the crannog of Drumgay, county
Fermanagh, there were implements for forming the meshes of
nets. They consisted of nine pieces of deer’s horn, varying in size
from six to little more than three inches in length. Four of them
are curiously fashioned. Similar objects, composed of the tips of
deer’s horn, have frequently occurred in crannog “finds,” and,
during excavations made about the year 1851, in Christchurch-place
and Fishamble-street, Dublin, many like specimens were
discovered. There can be little doubt that they were used for
making fishing lines or nets: indeed one of the discoverers having
procured some thread, at once proceeded to illustrate his theory by
the manufacture of a fishing line. The suggestion has also been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
offered that they may have been arrow or javelin heads. From
vegetable fibre the crannog dweller made nets with which he obtained
an ample supply of fish from the waters around him, and
sink-stones, used for either fishing
lines or nets, are by no means
a rare “find.” Quoit-like discs
of sandstone, pierced with a hole
to attach them to the bottom
rope of a net, are not uncommonly
employed, even in the
present day, in remote localities.
A bronze fishing-hook
picked up from the bottom of a
lake is here figured, and in plate <span class="smcapuc">XXIX.</span>, vol. ii., of Keller’s work,
there is a representation of one closely resembling it. In 1845
there was found in Lough-na-Glack, county Monaghan, a bolt
or missive of bronze, 16½ inches in length, evidently used for
spearing fish, and of which two illustrations are given in Shirley’s
<i>History of the County Monaghan</i>. The thong or string attached to
this weapon, and by which it was hauled back after projection,
was called in Irish <i>fuainemain</i>. The name is in the present day
applied by the herring fishermen of the south of Ireland to the
bolt-rope of their fishing-nets.</p>

discovered with other remains, now scattered and lost, in the crannog
of Drumsloe, near Ballinamallard, county Fermanagh. Articles
hollowed out of stone are somewhat rare in Ireland, but more than
one fine specimen occurs in the collection of the Royal Irish
Academy. A very perfect example similar to that found at Drumsloe,
and represented at page <a href="#Page_114">114</a>, <a href="#fig087">fig. 87</a>, in the Catalogue, was

be seen in Canon Grainger’s interesting Museum at Broughshane,
county Antrim. These curious vessels, though formed of stone, are
usually found with objects belonging to a supposed late iron period.
Cups strongly resembling them have been exhumed in connexion
with the so-called “Picts’ Houses” in Scotland, and in some of the
Lake Dwellings of that country.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> <a href="#plate17">No. 2</a> is a cauldron-like vessel
of thin, hammered bronze, measuring 22½ inches in diameter by
six inches in depth: it was found with many other objects of
interest in the crannog of Cloonfinlough. On its upper side it
presents a rim or lip measuring one inch in breadth, strengthened
by four small plates, fastened to the vessel by bronze rivets, and
placed at about equal distances from each other. <a href="#plate17">No. 3</a> represents
the upper portion of what had been a very large cauldron, with
rivet-holes indicating the points where staples had been fixed for
reception of rings, or the ends of a handle. The bronze, beaten to
extreme thinness, of which this specimen is composed, seems to be
of very early character. <a href="#plate17">No. 4</a>, a shallow bowl of oak, about
twelve inches in diameter, exhumed, with other remains, from the
crannog of Breagho, county Fermanagh, was quite perfect when
first laid bare, but on exposure to the atmosphere it split into
several pieces. <a href="#plate17">No. 5</a>, found in the crannog of Cloonfree,
county Roscommon, is a beautiful little vessel hollowed out of a
single piece of wood, and tastefully mounted with bronze fittings,
but the scale on which it is drawn is too small to admit of the
delicacy of its ornamentation being properly displayed. <a href="#plate17">No. 6</a> represents
an artistically formed ladle of extremely thin bronze,
measuring in all 11½ inches, the internal diameter of its bowl
being five inches. This ladle was discovered by turf-cutters in
the bog of Bohermeen, county Meath, in close proximity to a
large number of pointed stakes and other remains of timber,
doubtless portion of the framework of a crannog; but in 1848&mdash;the
date of its discovery&mdash;very little was known about lake dwellings,
and few particulars of the “find” can now be chronicled. This
vessel was bought at the time by W. F. Wakeman, and by him
(together with a beautiful bronze pin found with it) presented to
the late well-known antiquary Petrie, amongst whose collection,
deposited in the R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A., it may now be seen. In the same
Museum are several similar vessels, turned up during drainage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
operations in various parts of the country. They are supposed by
some writers, but apparently without sufficient reason, to be of
Roman origin: in Ireland, however, they are usually discovered
in connexion with remains of purely Celtic type, and it is not known
that in any instance classic decoration occurs upon an Irish example,
although in Munro’s <i>Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings</i>, a
bronze vessel (<a href="#fig013">fig. 13. p. 45</a>) of similar style is ornamented in undoubtedly
late Roman art. <a href="#plate17">No. 7</a> is a “coffee-pot”-shaped utensil
of bronze, discovered in the crannog of Rooskey, parish of Killevan,
county Monaghan, in June, 1876. It is seven inches in
height, by four in breadth at the centre. The sketch is from a
photograph of the original, kindly supplied for this work by Dr.
Gillespie, of Clones. The spout branches into two, each terminating
in the form of a monster’s head; the legs are finished like
claws, and the animal ornamentation on the concentric rings or
bands encircling the body of the vessel furnishes distinct evidence
of very late Celtic art. The handle no longer remains. This is
the only example recorded as having been as yet met with in an
Irish crannog, although bronze articles of the same class are not
uncommon&mdash;at least six others may be seen in the Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A.,
all from different localities, found either in bogs or in the beds of
rivers. A similar example, save that it does not possess a dual
spout, is figured at p. 24, <i>Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings</i>, and thus
is established another point of resemblance between the crannog
remains of the two countries, although Stuart in his <i>Notices of
Scottish Crannogs</i> remarks, that hardly any mention is made of the
bronze dishes, pots, or “coffee-pot” vessels, amongst the relics of
Irish crannogs which are so frequently found in those of Scotland.
Characteristic examples from Lagore of iron remains of a domestic
character are <a href="#plate17">No. 8</a>, evidently a flesh-fork, which measures, at
present, 13¼ inches from end to end; and <a href="#plate17">No. 10</a>, a knife, measuring
eighteen inches.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the majority of crannog culinary articles are
more or less rounded at their base; thus when placed over a fire
they would require to be suspended or have a support to steady them.
<a href="#plate17">No. 9</a>, from the great crannog of Lough Gur, county Limerick,
is composed of very fine iron, which had evidently been smelted
with wood charcoal; it is admirably adapted for the purpose of
sustaining a pot or other vessel over a fire of peat or wood, but it
is a comparatively modern article.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Bones of deer and other animals found in connexion with Irish
crannogs frequently bear marks of a saw, and <a href="#plate17">No. 11</a>, from
Lagore, represents an instrument of this class, measuring six inches
in length. It was, no doubt, secured by rivets to a back or handle
of wood, but the rivets no longer remain. Saws of this kind, some
larger, some smaller, have constantly accompanied crannog implements
of iron. <a href="#plate17">No. 12</a>, also from Lagore, is, seemingly, a ladle or
miniature frying-pan, scarcely eight inches in length.</p>

<p>In the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy there is a beautiful
thin saucer-shaped vessel, hammered out of a single piece of bronze
that has been cleaned to show the rich red golden colour of the
metal.</p>

<p><i>Querns</i>, or hand-mills, both of ancient and modern type, either
in a perfect state or else more or less broken, have been found in
most crannogs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> “<i>Grain-rubbers</i>, for triturating corn, are, perhaps,
the most primitive implements used in the manufacture of cereal
food. Each consisted of a flag or flat stone slightly hollowed upon
the upper surface, so as to hold the parched grain, and a convex
rubber, or mullet, which was passed backwards and forwards with
the hand, and thus bruised the corn into meal. Querns are
evidently the next step in
food-making machinery.…
Although there are several
varieties, the most simple
and natural division of them
is twofold. The first is
that in which the upper and
lower stone are simply circular
discs from twelve to
twenty inches across, the
upper rotating upon the lower by means of a wooden handle, or
sometimes two, inserted into the top, and fed or supplied with
corn by an aperture in the centre, analogous to the hopper, and
which may be termed the ‘grain-hole’ or eye. In this quern
the meal passed out between the margins of the stones. The
upper stones are usually concave and the lower convex, so as to
prevent their sliding off, and also to give a fall to the meal.”
The second variety is usually styled a <i>pot-quern</i>, and has a lip
or margin in the lower stone, which encircles or overlaps the
upper, the meal passing down through a hole in the side of the
former. Most of this variety are of smaller size than the foregoing,
which is evidently the more ancient and simple form, as
well as that which presents us with the greatest diversity. The
upper stone in the pot-quern was turned, as in the first-named
kind, either by one or sometimes by two wooden handles. This
kind of quern was denominated “bró.” The word, used in the
signification “to grind,” occurs in Proverbs, chap. xxvii., v. 22:
“Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat
with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.”</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 60.&mdash;Section of ordinary Quern.

</div>

<p>A gentleman in Ireland, who at the commencement of the present
century saw a quern at work, describes it as having the upper stone
(<a href="#fig060">fig. 60, A</a>) about twenty-two inches in diameter, its under surface
considerably concaved; the lower stone (<a href="#fig060">B</a>) was convexed, so that
an easy descent was afforded for the meal (<a href="#fig060">E</a>) when ground. In
the centre of the upper stone was a circular hole nearly three inches
in diameter, and through it the quern was “fed,” as it is called,
<i>i. e.</i> supplied with fresh corn (<a href="#fig060">EEE</a>) as fast as the bran and flour
fell from the sides of the machine. Within about two inches of the
edge was set an upright wooden handle (<a href="#fig060">D</a>) for moving the upper
stone, which rested in equilibrio on a strong peg or pivot (<a href="#fig060">C</a>) in the
centre of the lower stone. There were generally two women employed
in the operation. They
sat on the ground facing each
other, the quern between. One
of them with her right hand
pushed the handle to the
woman opposite, who again
sent it to her companion, and
in this manner a rapid rotatory
motion was communicated
to the upper stone, whilst the
left hand of the operator was engaged in the “feeding” process.
The corn, previously dried over a slow fire, when arrived at a
certain degree of crispness, was taken up to be ground. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
preparation prevented the raw taste perceptible in meal from
modern mills. Little cookery was required. The ordinary way of
using it was to mix the meal in its raw state with milk, to the consistency
of thick porridge, and it was then eaten without any other
accompaniment, the simple mixture being called “a crowdie.” A
quern is evidently the primitive kind of mill referred to in the Scriptures,
where it is said “two women shall be grinding at the mill:”
and Shakspeare makes Puck to “sometimes labour in the quern.”</p>

<p>In the centre of the crannog of Drumgay, county Fermanagh,
there was a large block of stone punctured with a cross, and
another resembling it was discovered many feet deep, in the centre
of the pagan carn of “The Miracles,” in the same district. Similar
figures are inscribed or punched upon rocks and upon the sides
of natural, or partly artificial caves, as at Loch na Cloyduff, <i>The
Lake of the Dark Trench or Diggings</i>, and the “Lettered Cave,” in
the cliffs of Knockmore, “<i>Great Knoll</i>,” county Fermanagh.
Within the precincts of well-authenticated pagan tumuli, as at
Dowth, cross patterns have been found, accompanied in several
instances by “scorings,” at present unintelligible. On the base
of a sepulchral urn, preserved in the Museum of the Royal Irish
Academy, the cross is displayed, and the figure of a cross within a
circle occurs on an urn discovered at Broughderg, county Tyrone.
Mr. Albert Wray has described some spoon-shaped objects of antique
bronze, all decorated with the figure of a cross similar in design
to the symbol as observable upon the earliest Irish quern-stones.
The bronze articles in question
exhibit a style of workmanship
which has invariably been associated
with pre-Christian times
in both Britain and Ireland;
whilst in the latter country discs
and thin plates of gold belonging
to the same period have been
found presenting a cross-like ornamentation.
At Drumgay, at
Lough Eyes, at Roughan, and
at Drumsloe, <i>the Ridge of the
Host</i>, were cross-inscribed querns.
Drumsloe lake, now almost
drained, is situated within a short distance of Ballinamallard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
county Fermanagh. Interesting objects, now dispersed or lost,
have been there from time to time turned up on the site of a crannog,
the traces of which are now nearly obliterated, and the curious
quern or <i>bró</i>, of which the accompanying cut is a facsimile, is
one of the few remaining relics authentically connected with the
locality. The quernstone measures one foot six inches in diameter.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>About the year 1839, upon lowering the level of the water for
drainage purposes in Roughan lake, near Dungannon, county
Tyrone, an island artificially formed was exposed to view. On
it were numerous fragments of pottery and bones, a bronze pin,
a few bronze spear-heads, together with a quern. The illustration
(<a href="#fig062">fig. 62</a>) represents the top stone, which is eighteen inches
in diameter, and two and a-half inches thick; it is formed of
sandstone, the ornamentation being in high relief. The hole or
socket for reception of the handle is in one of the arms of the
cross, and goes quite through the stone.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Portions of a highly
decorated quernstone, restored in the accompanying illustration
(<a href="#fig063">fig. 63</a>), were found in one of the crannogs in Lough Eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
On “Bone Island,” in the lake of Drumgay, several fragments of
quern-stones were collected. Two of those obtained were inscribed
with a cross-like ornamentation, one of them presenting a most
unusual style of crannog geometrical decoration.</p>

<p>On pottery at Ballydoolough, a cross pattern was observable, as
also on a comparatively modern iron article at Cloonfinlough, and
there was in a crannog in Argyleshire a Greek cross, with crosslets
as a pattern, or ornamentation, burnt into a piece of oak.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The
“Croix gammée,” or Swastika, occurs on sculptured stones in Scotland,
and appears on a mosaic pavement in the recently discovered
Roman villa in the Isle of Wight. In Keller’s <i>Lake Dwellings
of Switzerland</i>,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> a cross within a circle is represented: it was
found at Auvernier, and had seemingly been an article of personal
adornment. Layard, in his work entitled <i>Nineveh and Babylon</i>,
states that he found what is now called the Maltese and Irish
cross in such connexion as led him to identify it with the sun.
In these ancient sculptures the cross was often inserted within a
circle, which, having neither beginning nor end, was considered
to be the emblem of eternity, and may be so observed in Assyrian
sculptures. Dr. Schliemann, in his <i>Troja</i> (p. 167), gives a representation
of a curious copper or bronze ring, about the size of an
ordinary napkin ring, but very heavy. It has five compartments,
each ornamented with a cross marked by openings cut in the metal.
Amongst the whorls found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
by Dr. Schliemann, numbers
are ornamented with <img src="images/swastika-l.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="swastika" />
and <img src="images/swastika-r.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="swastika" />. The same sign is
found in Pompeii, and amongst
the ancient heathen population
of Yucatan and Paraguay.
“Later still, it was even adopted
by the Christians as a
suitable variety of their own
cross, and became variously
modified geometrically.” In
No. 1 crannog, in the lake of
Drumgay, there was a very
peculiar cross-sculptured stone,
two feet in length by three
inches in thickness. It is
seemingly of no great antiquity,
and was most probably
intended for a tombstone to
be placed in the neighbouring cemetery of Devenish.</p>

<p><i>Human Remains.</i>&mdash;There have been, as yet, few instances of
the discovery of human bones in crannogs. At Dunshaughlin,
in Meath, at Ardakillen and Cloonfinlough, in Roscommon, the
people appear to have met with a violent end, and there is no
reason to believe that the remains are very ancient. The lake
dwellers of Switzerland had cemeteries on the mainland, directly
opposite their habitations, and it is probable that the Irish disposed
of their dead in the same manner, but up to the present this subject
has not been investigated.</p>

<p><i>Fireplaces on the Shore.</i>&mdash;Numerous fireplaces on the shore
adjoining crannogs were discovered at Drumkeery lough, and at
Lough Eyes. In the immediate vicinity of the latter were traces
of gins or traps for catching game. In the neighbouring bogs
labourers have, at various times and in different localities, met
with stakes planted in the original surface soil, in a vertical position,
and sharpened to a point, seemingly by a clean-cutting
metallic tool. Since fixed in their original position the peat had
grown so much that it is now, on an average, about five feet above
the pointed ends. It has been often surmised that stakes planted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
thus were in some way connected with the trapping of deer and
other wild animals.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p><i>Pottery.</i>&mdash;Dr. Schliemann rightly designates fragments of pottery
as the cornucopia of archæological science; it is always abundant,
and it possesses two qualities&mdash;those, namely, of being easy to break,
and yet difficult to destroy, which render it very valuable in an archæological
point of view. Investigation has shown that the inhabitants
of crannogs had in use a description of fictile ware, distinctly
characteristic in style, graceful in form, and well manufactured,
admitted by English archæologists to be superior to that possessed
by the Britons or early Saxons. It is known that the primitive
people of Ireland possessed the art of constructing excellent fictile
ware for mortuary purposes of fire-hardened clay; they could
therefore manufacture every-day culinary vessels of the same
material. An immense quantity of pottery has been found in connexion
with many crannogs, by which means facilities are afforded
for comparing ordinary domestic vessels with the urns and vases
of an undoubtedly prehistoric and pagan period. The great majority
of specimens of crannog pottery present designs marked
upon them, similar in style to the ornamentation observable on the
walls of sepulchral cairns and the vessels deposited in them, on
golden or bronze ornaments, on implements, and on the surface of
rocks, all of which are usually acknowledged to date from prehistoric
times.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Mr. Rau states that the fictile vessels discovered by
him amongst the debris of Indian relics on the left bank of the
Cahokia Creek, on the Mississippi, opposite St. Louis, resemble
the ancient Irish fictilia, “more especially those found in crannogs
and kitchen middens.” One fragment showed punctured and
impressed ornamentation of the class so usual on Celtic urns. Mr.
Graves observes that the arts of primeval peoples may be illustrated
by comparison with those that prevail under similar conditions
of civilization existing in or near our own times. Thus in
India cromleac builders raise their megalithic monuments on hills.
In the Hebrides, cloghans, <i>i. e.</i> mortarless stone-built and roofed
habitations, similar to those strewn over the western littoral of
Connaught, and also lake dwellings in various parts of the world,
are even still occupied.</p>

<p>There were thirty-five distinct
patterns on the various
fragments unearthed, yet the
locality was not thoroughly
explored. Specimens of the
pottery from Ballydoolough
were forwarded to Mr. Albert
Wray, a well-known authority
on such subjects, and he would
not refer them to a very early
age, or to that in which the
use of bronze was prevalent. The mode of ornamentation appeared
to present a slight resemblance to the “Cuerdale Hoard,”
which is sometimes ascribed to the ninth century. W. F. Wakeman,
however, is of opinion that amongst the numerous designs
found upon the crannog vessels there is none suggestive <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>of the
work of Christian times in Ireland, unless the cross-marked fragments
be considered as such, chevrons and circular depressions
being all expressive of Pagan ideas of ornamental art.</p>

that figured upon the vessel found in “One Man’s Cairn,” at

portion of a decorated leathern shoe found in the crannog of
Dowalton loch, Wigtonshire, and of which a representation is
given at p. 49 of Munro’s <i>Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings</i>. The
fragments of vessels found in Lough Eyes were all hand-made,
and well burnt, whilst the action of the fire would seem to have
been greater on the interior than on the exterior. The material
used was the sandy clay of the district, or perhaps the grit may
have been added in order to give greater consistency to the paste.
In most of the specimens there are distinct traces of this sand, and
in the ruder examples particles of white stone of the size of very
small peas project from the surface. The colour varies from light
drab to a very dark brown, almost black, whilst some few are of a
reddish hue&mdash;but all are unglazed. Many fragments of pottery
have from time to time been disinterred from the site of the
crannogs in the lake of Drumskimly, county Fermanagh: one of

<p>The term “Lestar” comprises vessels of various shapes, and
of all kinds of material, although it is more generally applied to
those made of wood&mdash;several have been found in crannogs. In
a bog, occupying what in distant ages appears to have been the
site of a small lake, on the lands of Cavancarragh, county Fermanagh,
implements of flint, a fine bronze spear-head, and a
beautifully-shaped wooden vessel, were discovered, all buried
under peat. Now, according to the theory of some geologists,
a peat formation of such depth as covered them would, accord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>ing
to circumstances, take from six hundred to one thousand years
to accumulate, so that the articles found might be referred back
to any period from the thirteenth to the ninth century; and at
about this latter period, it is remarked, with regard to the
ornamentation observable on the wooden vessel, that a similar
style prevailed in the <span class="smcapuc">MSS.</span> and on stone work of that era, still
extant. The vessel was made of oak, the bottom alone being
alder: when first exhumed it was entire, and had a cover; the
original form seems to have been one of unusual beauty, and
the height about fifteen inches. The lid, now unfortunately lost,
is described as slightly convex, with a knob-like handle in the
centre, the ornamental work on it similar to that of the vessel
itself. On the dark shading round the rim, and between the
interlacing ornamentation, both of vessel and lid, traces were
apparent of some kind of pigment, or enamel, with which the
surface of the wood had been overlaid. In the crannog of Ballydoolough,
county Fermanagh, a vessel of wood was discovered
in an entire state, but from long saturation redu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>ced almost to
a state of pulp. The engraving (about one-fifth the real size),
gives a good idea of it. In process of drying, the vessel soon
lost all shape, and became strangely twisted and distorted.
On comparing this woodcut with a vase found in a small stone
chamber at Knocknecoura, near Bagnalstown, county Carlow,
and now in the Museum, R.I.A., a striking resemblance in form
is observable; the latter vessel is, however, more ornamental.
To find in a grave an urn of almost exactly the same shape
as a vessel undoubtedly used to hold food, suggests the idea
that the so-called sepulchral urns in cairns and graves need
not be viewed as necessarily intended to hold human ashes, or
the cremated bones of sacrifices. Might not the object of their
position have been to supply the warrior with food on his way
to the Happy Hunting Grounds of Tirnanog? A willow platter,
15 inches by 14 (<a href="#fig104">fig. 104</a>), was found in the crannog of Ballinderry.
It did not split much in drying, and is in a very good
state of preservation: one handle, however is defective, the other
is 2¾ inches in length by 4 in breadth. The dimensions of
<a href="#fig105">fig. 105</a> are as follows: extreme length from handle to handle,
31⅛ inches; length inside, 25¾ inches; extreme breadth across
the rim, 21⅛ inches. It is not so well preserved as its confrere
from Ballinderry, as it rent in drying, but has not become
either warped or twisted like the great majority of wooden
utensils exhumed from peat.</p>

<p>“Meadar,” or “<i>Mether</i>,” is the Irish designation for a species
of drinking cup, so called, it is said, because it was employed to
contain “mead.” It seems to have been commonly made of
yew, was quadrangular at the lip, and round at the bottom.
It was usually provided with two or more handles for the purpose
of passing it round from hand to hand. There was a curious
cup of this description in one of the crannogs of Lough Rea,
county Galway, too much decomposed, however, to be dug out in
an entire state; and at Lagore, near Dunshaughlin, was a four-sided
drinking vessel, composed of horn, and very small, being only
2½ inches in height; it resembles one discovered in the parish of
Tamlaght O’Crilly, county Derry.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The use of the <i>Mether</i> appears
to have been universal in Ireland, and continued to a late period,
whilst judging from the great depth at which it is found buried
in peat, its antiquity must be extreme. In drinking out of the
<i>Mether</i>, it was not the side, but one of the four corners that
should be applied to the mouth. It is related that when Lord
Townsend’s term of the Irish Vice-royalty had expired, he
carried over to England, on his return, two large methers, which
were always produced at his dinner parties. His guests generally
applied the <i>side</i> of the vessel to the mouth, therefore seldom
escaped without a drenched neck-cloth, vest, or doublet, and the

from Ardakillen.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcapuc">MS.</span> Book of Ballymote contains
an ancient Irish poem, which
states “It was Tigearnmas first
established in Ireland the art of
dyeing cloth of purple, and many
colours.” This monarch is alleged
to have lived, <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> 2816(?), therefore in Ireland
the arts of weaving and dyeing are of remotest
antiquity. Some bright red colouring matter
(realgar?), rolled up in a piece of birch bark,
was discovered in one of the crannogs of
Loughrea, county Galway;<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> orpiment, a yellow
sulphuret, probably used in dyeing, was
found in Cloneygonnell;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and,
whorls, or little discs, popularly
called by the peasantry
“fairy mill-stones,” are found
in great numbers; of these
<a href="#fig109">fig. 109</a> is a good example.
The whorl was supposed to
be simply a weight, used to
aid the rotation of the sti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>ck fixed to a ring on the spindle: it
can be seen in Egyptian, Greek, and Roman sculptures, and wall
paintings, and Schliemann in his excavations at Hissarlisk found
thousands of these objects. It has been
suggested that a curious ovoid piece of
hard polished bone, found at Ardakillen,
may have been utilised in weaving, for
the purpose of keeping the threads, or
cords in their proper places; its longest
diameter was 2½ inches, and it was perforated
with ten holes of slightly different sizes.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Investigation
has led to the belief that flax was cultivated in Egypt
more than forty centuries ago, and was thence brought
into Europe; it was discovered in the oldest lake dwellings in
Switzerland, of the kind which is native to the Mediterranean
countries; the term <i>lin</i>&mdash;the root of the English word <i>linen</i>,&mdash;is
to be traced in nearly every European language: in spoken
Irish it is <i>leen</i>, i.e. flax. The art of spinning, being of a sedentary
nature, was exclusively allotted to women, which is supposed to
explain the fact of such a number of whorls being found on the
site of crannogs, where this peaceful occupation was carried on.
In the present day, the province of Ulster seems to have monopolized
an industry that may be traced back to the primitive
inhabitants of the lake dwellings of Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="ARTICLES_OF_THE_TOILET" id="ARTICLES_OF_THE_TOILET"></a><i>Articles of the Toilet, etc., or of Personal Adornment.</i>&mdash;In
crannogs, pins form one of the most numerous handicraft “finds;”
they are fashioned of bone, wood, bronze, iron, and gold: great
variety is observable in their shape and design: indeed there are
few articles on which the crannog artificer has bestowed more
pains than on these cloak or dress fasteners. At Lagore, pins
of bone occurred absolutely in hundreds&mdash;the great majority were
of very plain character, something like skewers&mdash;flat-headed, and
perforated with one hole; some of the richer examples were
singular in design&mdash;their heads presenting grotesque human
figures, or carvings of beasts; a few of them terminated in
plain bulbs, or in a series of graceful mouldings: but whether
in bone, wood, or metal, the designs and style of ornamentation
are very varied, and so minute in some instances is the decoration,
as only fully to be descried by the aid of a magnifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>

<p>There are cracks, or openings, in the rings at the head of each
acus, by means of which the pendants may have been introduced;
but these cracks are possibly the result of wear or straining, and
it may be that both pendant and acus were originally carved
out of one piece, like Chinese chains of ivory rings. From the
same “find” came a pin with acus 4¾ inches long, having a
flat discoid pendant of considerable size, both acus and pendant
ornamented with the dot-and-circle; also a plain bone pin 2¼
inches long, with a hole at the head for a wire ring; another
plain bone pin 3 inches long, with a flat head unpierced for
ring or pendant; and a pin of yew, 2¼ inches long, with a
round head.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The scorings on these pins, though mostly mere ornament,
seem in some cases greatly to resemble Ogham and runic characters,
but Professor Stephens, of Copenhagen, to whom photographs
of the runic-like scribings were submitted, could not decide
that they were actually runes; and again, other examples of
bone pins from Ballinderry, preserved in the Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A.,
bear seemingly well-marked Ogham scorings, yet Professor Rhys
and Sir Samuel Ferguson were unable to interpret them.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The
pin given, <a href="#plate23">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXIII.</span>, fig. 1</a> (full size), bears ogham-like scorings
on the front of its disc, no doubt originally intended to convey a
meaning, but up to the present no key has been discovered by
which they can be read; it is possible they were intended as
a charm of some kind. <a href="#plate23">Fig. 2</a> (<a href="#plate23">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXIII.</span></a>) was not in the
Academy when Wilde compiled his catalogue: the head of this
pin is of stone, said to be agate, secured to the bone stem,
seemingly, by a small wedge of bronze. Near its termination,
the pin assumes an acutely quadrangular form, each face bearing
an ogham-like set of scorings; these may possibly also have been
talismans. Pins of bone, as well as of bronze, have been
frequently found with rings of that metal attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
to them, of a more or less ornamental type, but
sometimes consisting of a mere piece of wire.
<a href="#fig125">Fig. 125</a>, from Lisnacroghera, represents a rude
ring of this nature; and quite recently a bronze
pin, with similar attachment,
was picked up from the bed of
Drumcliff river, county Sligo. A pin of unusual
form, and ornamented with two human heads,
<a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>, was brought to light in the crannog of
Loughravel; the material is dark-coloured bronze,
cast in the required form, but finished off with a
chasing tool. In <a href="#fig127">fig. 127</a> the ring, with which
most pins are decorated,
assumes
the form of a
coin, or flattened
disc with a notch
at top to allow
it free play in the
loop. In some
specimens the
disc of the coin is
smooth and plain,
but in others,
as that here
represented, it is
highly ornate.

on its semicircular plate; the ground had originally been filled
in with enamel, as were probably the front terminations of the
tubes. It was found near a crannog in Craigywarren bog, parish
of Skerry, county Antrim. <a href="#fig131">Fig. 131</a>, from Lagore, is unique; its
entire length is 3 inches, and it has three rings passing through

were found at Lagore, and now form part of the Petrie Collection
in the Museum, R.I.A. <a href="#plate24">Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4</a> are of iron, of which
material very few ornamental objects have been found in Irish
crannogs. <a href="#plate24">No. 1</a> is remarkable as presenting a fine example of
the torque pattern. <a href="#plate24">Nos. 2, 3, and 4</a>, in form strongly resemble
brooch pins of bronze, which there is every reason to believe
belong to an extremely remote period. The bone pins, <a href="#plate24">Nos.
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11</a>, are faithful representations of the leading
varieties of that article, as found in Irish lake dwellings, and
indeed in some pagan tombs. <a href="#plate25">Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6</a> (<a href="#plate25">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXV.</span></a>),
are believed to represent wooden pins for the hair. <a href="#plate25">No. 1</a> remains
in a perfect state: the mouldings upon its lower and thinner end
were doubtless intended to keep the article in its proper place, and
prevent its slipping from the “back hair” of some long-forgotten
beauty. <a href="#plate25">No. 2</a> is unfortunately imperfect, but it is of interest on
account of the boldness of the mouldings by which its head is
decorated. <a href="#plate25">No. 3</a> is perhaps the most remarkable pin composed of
wood which has been recorded as found in a crannog: its decoration
consists chiefly of varieties of the divergent spiral, highly
characteristic of early Celtic art. <a href="#plate25">No. 4</a> may possibly have been
a hair-pin, but it was more probably used as a bodkin. <a href="#plate25">Nos. 5
and 6</a>, with serrated edges, seem well designed for the purpos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>e of
securing the hair in position. Pins of this kind were probably
used in pairs, attached together with a string. <a href="#plate25">No. 7</a> is a nondescript
piece of wood, with two perforations; and <a href="#plate25">No. 8</a> represents a
handle, probably belonging to a very small wooden vessel. <a href="#plate25">No. 9</a>,
shaped like one half of a wheel, is cut out of the solid, and appears
to have been very carefully worked. It is almost impossible to
form an opinion as to the character of this object: possibly it may
have formed portion of the head of a cross: if so, it is the only
relic of that kind hitherto reported to have occurred in a crannog.
<a href="#plate25">Nos. 10 and 11</a> are noticed by Wilde as seal-like articles. The
former of these is solid; but the latter, from its thicker end to the
moulding, is hollow.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Shears composed of iron, and doubtless used for all the purposes
of modern scissors, are common in Irish crannogs. Some from
Lagore are of graceful form, resembling articles of the same class
found in Roman settlements: the one represented, <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, is of very
large size, 8½ inches in length. Figs. <a href="#fig134">134</a> and <a href="#fig135">135</a> differ but little
from <a href="#fig133">fig. 133</a>, and they all resemble the implements commonly used
for shearing sheep in the present day. Figs. <a href="#fig136">136</a> and <a href="#fig137">137</a> are small
iron knives, with tangs for insertion into horn or wooden handles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
at Lagore, where these articles were found, great numbers of
blades, some not exceeding three inches in length, were discovered.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 138.&mdash;Bone Comb from Ardakillen.</p>
</div>

<p>Of combs, the most numerous specimens are from the crannogs
of Ardakillen, Ballinderry, Lagore, and Cloonfinlough: in some,
brass teeth have been substituted for those of bone that had given
way, showing that, at the time the repairs were made, that metal
was easily procured and worked. Strangely enough, the most usual
decoration consists of a series of dot-and-circle patterns. The
same style of ornamentation was observed upon many of the
combs found in the lake habitations of Switzerland, and amongst
the waifs of Roman settlements in Britain. In the remains of
such articles, in Irish and in Scottish lacustrine sites, there is a
striking resemblance; indeed the bone combs, figured in Munro’s
work, are identical with many existing Irish examples. Although
the material is usually bone, yet specimens formed of wood are
not uncommon: the great majority of combs discovered in Irish
crannogs are highly artistic in design&mdash;the handle portion sometimes
presenting animal forms. Sir John Lubbock says: “It is
somewhat remarkable that, while even in the stone period we find
fair drawings of animals, yet in the latter part of the stone age,
and throughout that of the bronze, they are almost entirely wanting,
and the ornamentation is confined to various combinations of
straight and curved lines and geometrical patterns;” and this he
believes will eventually be found to imply “a difference of race
between the populations of Western Europe at these different
periods.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The comb, <a href="#fig138">fig. 138</a>, was procured from the crannog of
Ardakillen, near Strokestown, county Roscommon. It is restored
from the fragments, and in its original state was (as delineated)
about 10 inches long, and 1¾ wide, it is now shrunk to a length of
only 5½ inches. The toothed portions are in separate pieces, and
by this contrivance the pectinated portion, if worn or broken,
could easily be replaced. The comb, <a href="#fig139">fig. 139</a>, is the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
specimen of its class preserved in the Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A., it is
2½ inches long, and 1¾ deep. The three pectinated portions are
held together by flat sides, decorated with scrolls and circles.
The top shows a triple openwork ornamentation: the side pieces
are grooved at one end, for the purpose of receiving the clasp of
a metal tooth placed in substitution of one that had been lost.
<a href="#fig140">Fig. 140</a>, of the same class, is a specimen of a short, one-sided,
highly decorated comb, 2¼ inches long, by 1⅜ deep. It is formed
out of a single piece of bone, is of graceful outline, and decorated
upon the sides with a number of dotted lines and circles. The
three elevated rivets projecting above the toothed portion, fastened
metal plates which had been attached to the comb, either when it
was originally made, or after it had been broken and mended.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
<a href="#fig141">Fig. 141</a> is also formed out of a single piece of bone, ornamented
with a dot-and-circle pattern; it was found in the same crannog.
A third variety of comb, being double-toothed, is of a type so
modern, that it seems to call for no special description.</p>

<p>Save combs, very few articles for the toilet have

however, any brooch, pin, or other object, upon which interlacing

to the introduction of Christianity into Ireland.</p>

</div>

<p>Of bronze articles connected with personal adornment, few can
equal in design and workmanship the hinge brooch from Ardakillen,
here represented; it is considered to be of great antiquity.
The decoration on the enlarged ends partakes of the “Celtic
trumpet pattern,” while the central connecting curved strap, with
a raised intertwinement, like that seen on some sculptured crosses,
and in the illumination of ancient <span class="smcapuc">MSS.</span>, would appear to have been
cast. The thin ornamented plate in front is fastened by eight
rivets to a stout flat plate behind, which also overlaps the edges of
the strap; its flat pin is hinged at the back.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The very remarkable
brooch, represented full size, <a href="#plate26">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXVI.</span></a>, was obtained by Petrie<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
soon after the first opening of the Lagore crannog. The original
discoverer stated that it was enclosed in an ancient case or box of
yew&mdash;this has unfortunately been lost. The material of which
the brooch is composed, is fine golden-coloured bronze, so lustrous
that, in places which have been rubbed or exposed to friction, it is
difficult to decide whether the article had not been originally gilt.
The pin is 6⅝ inches in length: the diameter of the ring 3⅝
inches. The deeply set compartments, or panels, some thirteen
in number, into which the ring is divided, contain ornamentation
in what is generally designated the Celtic style: these designs,
various in character and admirably executed, remain as sharp as
when originally made. It is decorated on the front only. The
ring, as is usual, expands on one of its sides, so as to fill up nearly
one-half of the circle. The head of the acus is secured to the ring
by a boldly projecting loop. The thickness of the plate forming
the ring is about a quarter of an inch; the edges are plain.
Another bronze brooch,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> in use amongst the crannog dwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>ers of
Lagore, is smaller than that shown on <a href="#plate26">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXVI.</span></a> The ring
measures but 2 inches in diameter; the head of the acus contains
a series of circular concentric mouldings, the intermediate spaces
being deeply sunk; in the centre is a cavity which formerly contained
a setting. The ring is continuous, and one of its sides
expands, exhibiting circles (similar to those ornamenting the head
of the pin), in one of which a fine setting of amber still remains;
the other is now empty. There is no trace of enamel having been
used on this brooch. A beautiful bronze fibula, or brooch, found
on the site of the crannog of Lough Ravel, is here reproduced (full
size), from the engraving in the late <i>Ulster Journal of Archæology</i>.
This brooch, and one of silver from the same locality, are distinguished
by their peculiar bird-head ornamentation on the
superior extremity. From the same crannog
came the penannular ring or brooch (<a href="#fig148">fig. 148</a>);
and, from Ardakillen, a small penannular ring
(<a href="#fig149">fig. 149</a>), of most curious torque pattern; indeed,
penannular rings of bronze, of various
sizes, sometimes highly decorated in very
primitive style, are of not unfrequent occurrence
in Ireland: they are supposed by some
writers to have been used as a kind of money;
others have pronounced them to be finger-rings, or bracelets,
according to their size; similar objects are met with in gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>, and,
like their bronze prototypes, have greatly puzzled the learned
in antiquarian matters. At the crannog of Lisnacroghera were
found two penannular rings, formed of very thin, golden-coloured
bronze. They are hollow, and consequently extremely
light, so that they could scarcely have served as money: and
the smallness of their diameter, which is only 1⅜ inches, shows
that they could not have been bracelets. The following articles
are also from Lisnacroghera. <a href="#fig151">Fig. 151</a>, a
bronze stud&mdash;use problematical. <a href="#fig152">Fig. 152</a>,
a plain bronze rivet. The circlets of bronze,
figs. <a href="#fig153">153</a>, <a href="#fig154">154</a>, <a href="#fig155">155</a>, may have been either
the rings of brooches or pins, or perhaps
buckles which had lost their tongues.
<a href="#fig155">Fig. 155</a> still retains traces of red enamel

<p>Touchstones would appear, from their make, to have been
worn about the person, several being pierced with a hole, seemingly
for attachment of a string. Sir W. Wilde remarks that
they have been found both flat and four-sided, and with and
without perforation. They are formed generally of black Lydian
stone or of jasper, either material being suitable for gold-testing.
Lydian stone, or black chert, is “an impure flint, found in the
central portions of the carboniferous limestone of Ireland, and at
the base of the Kilkenny coal formation. It is of a dull dark colour,
approaching to black; is more opaque, brittle, and stone-like, than
flint; never possesses the same translucency, and does not so readily
chip into conchoidal fragments: but, next to flint, it is one of the
hardest of the siliceous rocks, and hence was used occasionally for
forming tools and weapons by the inhabitants of those districts
where flint was rare. Lydian stone, ‘Lapis Lydius,’ or, ‘Lapis
Hibernicus,’ as it was denominated by the old Dutch writer De
Boot, so long ago as 1647, is the true touchstone of the ancients.”</p>

<p>Few ornaments of silver, and still fewer of gold, have been
brought to light in crannogs, the antiquities of which consist
mainly of the more homely class of bone, bronze, and iron articles
for personal adornment; yet numerous gold ornaments have
doubtless been discovered, but remained unrecorded, from fear of
detection on the part of the finder, before the Treasury Minute
respecting “Treasure Trove” came into operation. Antique
articles of gold have been turned up in the bogs of Ireland, and in
various parts of the country. Is it likely that the inhabitants of
“island fortresses” should alone be devoid of the precious metal,
especially as in them have been found both small earthen
crucibles&mdash;so diminutive as to have been useful only for gold
or silver smelting,&mdash;and also small pipe-clay
cupels for refining purposes, like those used
in the present day for the assay of gold and
silver? <a href="#fig156">Fig. 156</a> represents a pipe-clay crucible
from the crannog of Lagore, 2 inches broad,
and 1 inch high. A well authenticated instance
of the discovery of the precious metal in
a crannog, was that of “several gold pins,” at Loughtamand,
county Antrim;<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and, in the autumn of 1870, a beautiful, almost
unique, specimen of early Irish art came to light on the site of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the former lake dwelling of Lough Ravel, county Antrim. The

This silver brooch, or fibula,
represents two bird-headed
serpents joined
together: both sides of

the silver is slightly
thinner than a shilling
piece; the pin is missing.
In the design there seems
to be a resemblance to
some of the initial letters

</div>

<p>Beads of stone, bone, jet, earthenware, and wood, occur in
crannogs; also beads of amber, of which many are in modern
use amongst the peasantry as prayer-beads. O’Flaherty, in his
<i>Iar Connaught</i>, states that amber was procured in more or
less quantities on the coast of Galway. Ornaments of glass,
from the most simple and unpretending plain blue bead to that
studded with settings of enamel or vitreous paste, so varied in
colour and of so much beauty in outline that they might be worn
at the present day, are still met with in crannogs, as well as in
pagan sepulchres. Blue appears to have been the favourite colour,
but some are pale green, white, yellow and red, with spirals and
decorations of varied colours; whilst others have a dark groundwork,
and are studded with fragments of red, green, yellow, blue
and white enamel. All the beads figured in <a href="#plate27">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXVII.</span></a> are drawn
full size. <a href="#plate27">No. 1</a>, formed of stone, presents an average specimen of
its class. <a href="#plate27">No. 2</a> is from Lagore, where a considerable number, but
of smaller size, occurred. <a href="#plate27">No. 3</a>, composed of bone, is probably
the largest bead of that material found in any crannog: usually,
they are scarcely the size of an ordinary pea. <a href="#plate27">No. 4</a> is a pendant
of black opaque glass; it probably formed the centre of a necklace.
One resembling it, but composed of stone, may be seen in the
Petrie Collection, R.I.A. <a href="#plate27">No. 5</a> is a small bead of blue glass; its
form is one of rare occurrence. <a href="#plate27">No. 6</a>, of plain cylindrical outline,
was accompanied by several others of the same class: in colour it
is a dull green. <a href="#plate27">No. 7</a>, a small globular bead of glass: colour
deep blue; and <a href="#plate27">No. 8</a>, of similar shape, is composed of opaque
white glass, or porcelain. <a href="#plate27">No. 9</a> is a beautiful bead of green
glass, presenting in dark-blue the dot-and-circle pattern; the
spaces between the dots and their surrounding circles are pure
white, so that a very pleasing effect is produced. <a href="#plate27">No. 10</a> is
an unusually long bead, of material similar to <a href="#plate27">No. 6</a>. <a href="#plate27">No. 11</a>
is a curious bead, through which passed a piece of bronze wire,
which probably formed the loop of a pin. <a href="#plate27">No. 12</a> is formed
of dark-green glass, relieved by yellow ornamentation, as shown
in the representation; and <a href="#plate27">No. 13</a> is of dark-blue opaque glass,
or paste, with chevrons of white glass, or enamel, passing round it.
<a href="#plate27">No. 14</a> is formed of white glass, or porcelain, ornamented with
a pattern in black, and the opening for the string unusually large.
<a href="#plate27">No. 15</a> is composed of very light-coloured blue glass; and <a href="#plate27">No. 16</a>
of pure crystal. <a href="#plate27">No. 17</a>, formed of jet, was accompanied by
fragments of bracelets of the same material. <a href="#plate27">No. 18</a>, appar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>ently
formed of fine clay, its colour what artists call Venetian red,
is in the Petrie Collection. <a href="#plate27">No. 19</a> is, undoubtedly, most curious,
not on account of its form or design, which is common, but
in regard to its being made of lead&mdash;perhaps the only example
of a bead of that material discovered in Irish crannogs. <a href="#plate27">No. 20</a>
is a fine specimen of the amber bead, so often discovered in
connexion with very early remains. <a href="#plate27">No. 22</a> is also an amber
bead, of rather unusual form, being almost flat, like a wheel.
<a href="#plate27">Nos. 23 and 24</a> were picked up by W. F. Wakeman, from the
shores of one of the crannogs of Lough Eyes, but at a time
subsequent to the publication of his Paper on that locality.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
The collection of glass and enamel beads in the Museum, R.I.A.,
contains one of long cylindrical form, composed of blue, white,
and yellow enamel; it is ¾ of an inch long, is decorated with a
blue and white band round each extremity, and has yellow spots on
the centre: it is of the same character as <a href="#fig162">No. 41</a>, represented by
<a href="#fig162">fig. 162</a>. <a href="#fig163">No. 21</a>, one of the most beautiful beads in the collection,
<a href="#fig163">fig. 163</a>, measures half an inch in the longest diameter, and
is composed of clear glass, with bright yellow spirals of opaque
enamel covering its sides. <a href="#fig164">No. 27</a>, represented by <a href="#fig164">fig. 164</a>, is
an opaque bead of glass, light-green in colour: the aperture is
rather large, so that it may have been used as a necklace, or
pin-bead; it is grooved in melon-form. Two beads, composed
of green glazed-ware, and also of melon-shape, may be seen
figured at page 178, in Munro’s <i>Scottish Lake Dwellings</i>. Nos.
20, 21, and 27, Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A., are from the crannog of Lagore.</p>

<p>The three following beads here described are from the crannog
of Lisnacroghera. <a href="#fig165">Fig. 165</a>, of opaque blue glass, very dark in
colour, but relieved with white streaks of the same material,
crossing each other obliquely. <a href="#fig166">Fig. 166</a>, of ordinary blue glass,
quite plain; and, <a href="#fig167">fig. 167</a>, an elongated cylindrical bead of
amber.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> In Wilson’s <i>Prehistoric Annals of Scotland</i>, and in
Keller’s <i>Ancient Lake Dwellings of Switzerland</i>, may be seen representations
of beads, greatly resembling one from the crannog of
Lough Ravel, county Antrim, as shown in <a href="#fig168">fig. 168</a>. <a href="#fig169">Fig. 169</a>,
from the same locality, is somewhat similar, but the yellow,
raised and rope-like decoration which encircles it does not form
an integral part of the glass; it has been produced by laying
the colour on the surface, instead of its being fused into the glass.
The bead, <a href="#fig170">fig. 170</a>, although from the lands of Ballintlea, near
Timahoe, Queen’s County, is of the same
class as many discovered in crannogs.
At top and bottom it exhibited indications
of friction, showing it had been
strung with others as a necklace, or some
article of personal adornment. It is formed
of sea-green glass, moulded to represent
interlaced cords, the strands composed of
threads of white glass; round the upper and lower rims there
are small knobs of opaque yellow glass. That these beads are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of native Irish manufacture is extremely probable, as, in two
instances at least, lumps of blue glass in an unfashioned state
have been discovered in connexion with crannogs, which also
yielded beads of exactly the same colour and material. The
majority of the beads present internal evidence of the manner
in which they were made: “the glass has at first been in the
form of a rod, then a portion, when in a soft state, was bent
into the form of a bead, and sufficiently heated to cause the ends
to unite.… When the ornamentation is composed of a spiral
rod, it has been laid on in the same way, and the line of junction
can be made out in every case.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p><a name="MUSIC" id="MUSIC"></a><i>Music.</i>&mdash;It has been remarked that, in order to form a just
estimate of the character of any particular people, it is necessary
to investigate the pastimes and amusements most prevalent amongst
them; war, and other contingent circumstances may place men at
different times in different points of view, but when we follow
them into the retirement of their homes, we are most likely to see
them in their true state. In crannogs few musical instruments
have come to light, owing probably to the perishable materials of
which they were usually composed, yet enough remain to prove
that, in time of peace, the sweet sound of the harp, and in war, the
hoarse bray of the trumpet, resounded over the waters of the
lakes. Portions of ancient harps have not unfrequently occurred
in crannogs, but no fairly perfect example has as yet come to
light. Some harp pins are formed of bronze, and several of
bone were found at Ardakillen. In the Museum, R.I.A., there
are upwards of twenty harp pins, the majority obtained from
crannogs: they vary in length from 2⅛ to 4⅛ inches, are square
in the head, and perforated in the smaller extremity, for holding
the wire string. In the accompanying <a href="#plate28">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXVIII.</span></a>, is figured (1)
an Irish harp as restored: it stands at present 37 inches in height,
all the metal portions were discovered in the crannog of Ballinderry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>,
county Westmeath, and the proportions and form of the
modern woodwork were regulated by the size and form of the
original metal work; the thirty-five pins show the number of
strings that were formerly attached. Although the style of
decoration is of a very early character, yet as the letters I.H.S.,
surmounted by a cross, appear engraved on a brass plate in
front of the instrument, the work cannot be older than the
sixteenth century. <a href="#plate28">Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5</a>, convey a clear idea of
the kind of ornamentation on the metal fittings, and <a href="#plate28">No. 7</a> (from
Drumdarragh crannog) represents a harp pin of the usual kind.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1809, at Ardbin, parish of Annaghclone, county Down,
both joints of a very large and perfect curved bronze trumpet, or
bugle-horn, were disinterred from a peat bog that had been a
sheet of water about the middle of the last century. As conclusive
proof of there having been a crannog in this former lake-bed,
a stratum of burnt oak, a canoe scooped out of a single tree,
together with four short paddles, were dug up from the peat.
Of the trumpet, the remains&mdash;minutely described in the <i>Newry
Magazine</i> for 1815&mdash;are now in the Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A., and in the
accompanying engraving (<a href="#fig172">fig. 172</a>) the outside trumpet is a
representation of this instrument. As may be observed, from
comparison with the various other horns in the Museum, it is
by far the largest of that collection, and is probably (as asserted
by Wilde) the finest of its kind discovered in Europe. The
trumpet is given on a larger scale in <a href="#plate29">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXIX.</span></a>: “it measures
8 feet 5 inches along the convex margin, and consists of tw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>o
portions, each formed of very strong sheet bronze of a yellowish
red colour, and joined along the seam.” It is 3½ inches wide at
the open of the large end, and ⅝ at the upper; the small tube has
parallel sides, and is about the size of the small extremity of the
larger. By what means the two were joined together, or whether
a mouth-piece was attached to the small extremity, is unknown,
yet a variety of loud martial tones can be produced by the lower
fragment. “The riveting of the edges in this instrument is the
most perfect thing of its kind yet discovered, and is well exhibited
in the accompanying cut, drawn the natural size from portions of
its external and internal surfaces. The bronze strap which covers
the joining on the inside is studded with small circular-headed
studs, riveted on the outside, as shown in the lower section of the
cut. There is no strap externally; and the perfection of the
riveting has long been a subject of admiration to the curious,
there being as many as 638 rivets in the lower portion.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> By what
means they were introduced throughout, or what description of
mandril was employed for riveting them upon, is still subject of
speculation.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> To judge from its size, this kind of war trumpet
should give no uncertain sound. It is stated by Polybius, that on
the continent “the parade and tumult of the Celts terrified the
Romans, for t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>here was amongst them an infinite number of horns
and trumpets,” &amp;c. And in describing the Celtic Gauls, Diodorus
Siculus says, “they have amongst them trumpets peculiar as well
to themselves as to other nations; these by inflation emit an
hoarse sound well suited to the din of battle.”</p>

<p><a name="AMUSEMENTS" id="AMUSEMENTS"></a><i>Chess, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;In early Irish <span class="smcapuc">MSS.</span> frequent mention is made of
chess as a favourite amusement of the Celtic people; and in “The
Dialogue of the Ancient Men”&mdash;a valuable tract contained in the
<i>Book of Lismore</i>&mdash;there is a curious passage relating to a game of
chess, the players being Finn Ban Mac Breasel, son of the king of
Leinster, and Guaire Goll, one of Fionn Mac Cumhail’s chess-bearers;
the wager was three ounces of gold, and the players
quarrelled as usual. The passage is here given as a record of the
prevalence of this game at a remote period: “And these two
played for three days, and Guaire did not win one game during
that time. And he threw down his wager, and insulted and abused
the other man, and he said ‘he was not a servant in service, nor
a vassal in vassalage, nor a hero in heroism;’ and Finn Ban
raised his fist, and gave Goll a blow that brought three front teeth
out of his upper jaw, and they fell together on the back of the
chess board.” Another anecdote in proof of the prevalence of the
game may be found in O’Curry’s <i>Manners and Customs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Ancient Irish</i>; in it the scene is also laid in the pagan age,
but anterior to the time of the famous Finn Mac Cumhail&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> “It
was a century before the Incarnation, that Eochaidh
Airemh was monarch of Erinn, and his queen was the celebrated
Edain, a lady remarkable not only for her beauty, but for her
learning and accomplishments. One day that Eochaidh was in his
palace at Teamair (according to this ancient story), a stranger of
remarkable appearance presented himself before him: ‘Who is
this man who is not known to us, and what is his business?’ said
the king. ‘He is not a man of any distinction, but he has come
to play a game at chess with you,’ said the stranger. ‘Are you a
good chess-player?’ said the king. ‘A trial will tell,’ said the
stranger. ‘Our chess-board is in the queen’s apartment, and we
cannot disturb her at present,’ said the king. ‘It matters not,
for I have a chess-board of no inferior kind here with me,’ said
the stranger. ‘What do we play for?’ said the king. ‘Whatever
the winner demands,’ said the stranger. They played then
a game, which was won by the stranger. ‘What is your demand
now?’ said the king. ‘Edain, your queen,’ said the stranger,
‘but I will not demand her till the end of a year.’ The king
was astonished and confounded; and the stranger, without more
words, speedily disappeared.” It is clear that chess is a game of
great antiquity,</p>

<p>From the crannog of Lagore was obtained a thin stone or slab
of squarish form, measuring about 14 inches on either side. It
presented upon its upper surface a number of squares as on a
chess-board.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The material for this purpose, however, varied considerably,
for in the “Annals of Clonmacnoise” it is stated that
when <i>Muirchertach</i> of the leathern cloaks (who lived in the middle
of the tenth century) carried off the body of Cerbhall, king of
Leinster, he caused a chess-board to be formed out of his bones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>.
Instances of utilizing the osseous remains of a dead adversary were,
in ancient times, not uncommon. The old Vikings, in imitation
of their gods, quaffed their ale out of goblets composed of the
crania of their enemies.</p>

<p>In Irish lacustrine sites a number of discs, formed apparently
of deer’s horn, or bone, have been frequently met with; these
articles, as a rule, are ornamented on one side only with the dot
and circle pattern, such as appears upon combs and other objects
of bone; many were found at Lagore, Cloonfinlough, Ballinderry,
&amp;c., and they resemble one from the Loch of Forfar, figured in
Munro’s <i>Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings</i>. The term “whorl” has
been very generally applied to these discs, the supposition being,
that their use was to aid in the rotation of the distaff or spindle.
Some Irish archæologists, however, have suggested the idea of
their being rather draughtsmen, or counters for a game; and
English antiquarians have pronounced a similar opinion with
regard to ivory discs discovered in that country. The latter
suggestion certainly carries with it a great degree of probability;
and although the game of draughts as now played cannot claim
great antiquity, yet there were other pastimes in which little
stones, shells, or nuts were employed by the ancients; but, as the
arts of man progressed, “stones and shells were laid aside, and
ivory counters became their substitute.” Croften Croker in his
tour through Ireland early in the present century observed two
peculiar games then almost universal amongst the peasantry; one
of them was played on lines usually marked on a board with
chalk, as shown in <a href="#fig174">fig. 174</a>. “Each player
is provided with three counters (<i>small black
and white pebbles or shells</i>) which are simply
deposited on the board in turn; the game is
won by getting these three counters in a
straight line. The centre point is considered
the most advantageous, and is always taken
by the first player: when all the counters
are deposited, moves are made from one
point to the next should it be unoccupied, and so on until a
careless move on either side decides the game, by allowing the
adversary to form his three counters in a row.” The unperforated
discs ornamented on one side only it may be fairly
surmised had served either in draughts or in games<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> of that
nature. <a href="#fig175">Fig. 175</a> represents a specimen of this class found in a
“souterraine” at Drumcliff, county Sligo, in company with
calcined bones and traces of iron remains; it seems to be identical
in style, size, and material with those found in crannogs, as
for example <a href="#fig176">fig. 176</a>, from the crannog of Cloonfinlough, ornamented
with a border of circles with dots in the centre surrounding
four groups of similar circles: each group consists of four
circles. <a href="#fig177">Fig. 177</a>, from the same locality, is plainly decorated
with five circles arranged in a cruciform pattern. Both these

<p>With regard to the perforated discs, it should be borne in
mind that they were of the same size as the <i>unperforated</i>, were
decorated with similar designs on one side only, and that it is
almost incredible so much trouble should have been bestowed on
the ornamentation of an object intended to serve merely as a
spindle whorl, as for example on the accompanying examples
from Lagore. The more natural inference seems to be, that
these discs were employed in some game&mdash;say chess&mdash;the pe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>rforations
being intended for reception of the upper parts, marking
the distinctive character of the various pieces used in the game.
<a href="#plate25">Nos. 10 and 11, plate <span class="smcapuc">XXV.</span></a>, may possibly have been these distinctive
upper portions. An object similar to <a href="#fig180">fig. 180</a> is described in the
<i>Catalogue of the Museum, R.I.A.</i>, as a “whorl,” in which a portion
of the lower end of the bone spindle still projects; but might it
not equally be supposed to represent a chessman&mdash;possibly a
pawn&mdash;judging from the simple outlines of its projecting
portion?</p>

<p><a href="#plate30">Plate <span class="smcapuc">XXX.</span>, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4</a>, from Lagore, and now in the Petrie
Collection, R.I.A., are all perforated. <a href="#plate30">Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and

these are unperforated, therefore could not have been used as

ornamented, but only on one side; all the above are of bone;
<a href="#plate30">Nos. 12 and 13</a>&mdash;both of them composed of stone and perforated&mdash;also
came from some of the crannogs in the neighbourhood of
Strokestown, and the latter is a good specimen of the so-called

of them have been discovered in a great variety of places,
in carns, crannogs, plough lands, &amp;c.</p>

it may also be observed, that in similar writings frequent mention

monkish period of Christianity, the <i>Ogham name</i> may <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>mean
simply what in the present day would be termed <i>the name in
Religion</i>. It is, however, immaterial for the present purpose to
which category Ogham characters be assigned, for in either case
they belong to the metallic age, as probably no race in the stone
age had attained the art of communicating ideas by means of
an alphabet. Even in the present day, when seeking to civilize
barbarous tribes, it is found essential, for the purpose of imparting
information, to adapt their languages to an alphabet.
Ogham may be briefly described as an arrangement of strokes,
or indented lines or notches cut on the arris, though sometimes
found on the flat of the stone or other material, when a straight
line is substituted for the arris. The letter is denoted by the
length of the stroke or notch, its position, whether above or below
the arris or line, or appearing both above and below, and likewise
the number of strokes or notches grouped together. Oghamic
scribings have been found on a stone in the crannog of Ballydoolough,
and on bone pins and other ornaments in the crannogs
of Ballinderry and the Strokestown group. Ogham appears to
have been employed not only for mortuary inscriptions carved
on pillar-stones erected over celebrated warriors, but also, in the
same manner as we now use the Roman alphabet, for communication
by messengers, &amp;c. On one occasion a celebrated mythical
Irish hero, named Cuchullain, when traversing a forest saw an
inscribed pillar-stone, and hung round it a verse in Ogham
character, carved by him upon a withe.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The <span class="smcapuc">MS.</span> from which
this anecdote is quoted was compiled about the year 1106. The
same hero is elsewhere represented as sending information to
Meave, queen of Connaught, by means of cutting or scribing
on wands; the son of a Scottish chief is described as cutting
Ogham characters on a spear. The date of the latter incident
is assigned to the commencement of the Christian era. Another
instance is mentioned, partaking however more of the nature of a
regular letter. In <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 408, Corc, son of the king of Munster,
was driven by his father into exile; he fled to the court of
Scotland; but, before appearing in the king’s presence, an Ogham
inscription on his shield was discovered and deciphered by a
friend, who thus saved the prince’s life, the inscription being to
the effect that, should he arrive at the Scottish Court by day, hi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>s
head was to be cut off before evening, and if by night it was
to be cut off before morning.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>It is almost needless to add, that all Ogham mortuary scribings
are in very antique language, thereby adding considerably to the
difficulties attending any attempt at translation of these archaic
inscriptions. The Gaelic of to-day, where it yet lingers, is to the
ancient dialect much what modern English is to the Anglo-Saxon
of olden times. The oldest lettered characters of the Irish lake
dwellers are Ogham or runic-like markings on stones, amulets,
pins, and brooches. An important “find” at Ballydoolough
consists of a block of hard reddish sandstone, measuring 2 feet
1 inch in length, by 4½ inches in breadth, and 6 inches in depth.
On it are well-marked Ogham characters, and these, when read
by the light of the Ogham alphabet, would seem to spell the
word <span class="gesperrt smcapuc">BALHU</span>.</p>

<p><a name="MONEY" id="MONEY"></a><i>Money.</i>&mdash;The precious metals, shaped for purposes of traffic,
at once stamp crannog “finds” with a modern, or at least with
an historic date. Very few coins, however, have come to light;
the most numerous are of the reigns of Mary and Elizabeth, some
of them being forgeries. In the crannog of Cloonfinlough the
coins varied in date from one of the Emperor Hadrian to a
specimen of the brass money of James II. One coin was discovered
under such strange circumstances that it claims special
mention:&mdash;In the lake adjoining the glebe house, in the parish
of Aghnamullen, county Monaghan, there are two islands, and
about the year 1850 one of them was for the first time ploughed,
and many curious antiquities turned up. In 1863, the rector
then in possession, while seated on the island, and peering into
the water, observed what to him appeared a button on the leaf
of a water-plant growing up from the bottom of the lake; on
pulling the leaf, this proved, however, to be an ancient coin&mdash;a
half groat of the reign of Edward III. The natural growth
of the aqueous vegetation had thus lifted to the surface of the
lough some of its buried treasures.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Strange as is this incident, it is surpassed by one related in
connexion with the discovery of a silver penny of King John. It
appears that upon preparing a fish of the bream species, taken in
Dalkey Sound, the coin referred to was found in its stomach, and
as it is on record that some time during the reign of John, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
ship containing a large sum of money was sunk close to the
place where the fish was captured, it is but reasonable to suppose
that the coin in question had formed a portion of the lost treasure.</p>

<p><a name="HORSE_FURNITURE" id="HORSE_FURNITURE"></a><i>Horse Furniture.</i>&mdash;At Ballinacarriga, near Moate, county Westmeath,
the peaty mould of a lake, now almost dried up, has at
various times yielded numerous objects of interest. One of them
(<a href="#plate31">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXI.</span></a>) is thus described by Alderman Day, F.S.A.:&mdash;“It
somewhat resembles in shape the wooden forepart of a cavalry
saddle of the present day, but here the likeness ends; this piece of
horse furniture is covered with interlaced knot-work of the choicest
kind, similar to the well-known ornamentation upon our ancient
Irish crosses. The timber composing it is yew, which fortunately
was preserved by being deposited in the peaty mould of the lake
bottom. The centre of the pommel is pierced by a very Moorish-looking
horse-shoe ornament, and both sides of the timber are
carved in compartments, no two of which are alike in their filling
up of scroll and net-work. Even the top of the pommel, of both
near and off side, differs in the pattern of the ornament. The
points of the pommel at both sides are pierced with two holes,
where the mark of the fong is apparent, by which the forepart
was secured to the lateral boards which formed the seat of the
saddle, and both points are grooved for the reception of these
boards.” Bridle-bits, or cheek-pieces, were discovered in Loughran
Island, in the river Bann: of these, one is quite plain, and the
other remarkably slender; it measures 6 inches across&mdash;the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
metal rein-straps still remain on the posterior loop. The third,
<a href="#fig184">fig. 184</a>, represents a fragment merely, of one that had borne
ornamentation.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig185">Fig. 185</a> represents cheek-pieces from the crannog of Lough
Faughan, and from Ardakillen. The bit proper, by which
cheek-pieces of this class were connected, appears to have been
almost invariably composed of iron. A perfect specimen with
bronze mountings is represented in Shirley’s <i>History of County
Monaghan</i>. An example of the iron bit which is supposed to
have succeeded that composed of bronze and iron is here given.
It came from Lagore, as did also several flat pieces of iron, which
there is reason to believe had been attached as ornaments to some
article of horse trapping. They measure 3 inches or so in length,
by about ¾ of an inch in breadth, and are most curiously decorated
in enamel of various colours, the patterns being geometrical
interlacing figures in the style known as <i>Opus Hibernicum</i>; at the
time of their discovery, they presented the only examples of
enamel on iron which had then been noticed, and some of them
may now be seen in the Petrie Collection of the Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A.
It is not known when enamel was first used in Ireland. Some
writers refer its invention to the Gauls, on the authority <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>of a
passage from Philostratus (who lived about the commencement of
the third century), to the effect that the barbarians bordering on
the ocean knew how to spread colours upon hot metal so as to
become on the cooling of the material as hard as the substance
over which they were laid. <a href="#fig187">Fig. 187</a> represents a small plate of
iron, covered with a rich pattern in enamel&mdash;vermilion,
yellow, and black; and fig. 188
is an ornament of mixed metal supposed,
like the preceding, to belong to a piece of
horse furniture: it is inlaid with red, brown,
and yellow enamel, and “exhibits also
specimens of a remarkable glass-mosaic in
chequered work of blue and white, encrusted
in cavities chiselled out on the face of
the metal. This kind of ornament is found
occasionally on ancient Irish works in metal,
it bears much resemblance to some antique
ornaments discovered with Roman remains,
and it occurs on the curious bronze basin
found in the bed of the river Witham near Lincoln.”</p>

<p><a name="MISCELLANEOUS" id="MISCELLANEOUS"></a><i>Miscellaneous Articles.</i>&mdash;It would be impossible to classify all
the articles brought to light on lacustrine sites; indeed the use to
which some of them were, or could be, applied must now be purely
conjectural, so widely do the habits of life in the present advanced
state of society differ from the rude and primitive existence of the
lake dweller. To the representation of objects, whose use could
not now be defined with any degree of accuracy, have been added&mdash;since
the work went to press&mdash;a few plates of miscellaneous
articles that fell under the writer’s observation in the interval.
They are of interest, as throwing still further light on the details
of the lake dwellers’ ordinary pursuits.</p>

<p>Amongst the debris of crannogs have been found several
designs carved upon the polished surface of the larger bones of
mammalia. Sir W. Wilde observed that clear, sharp, and accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
impressions might be made from some of these carvings in the
same way that proofs are taken from a woodcut. In some instances
the pattern is elaborately finished, and would answer
equally well “as a design for the panel of a stone cross, the
decoration of a doorway, or cornice of a round tower, a compartment
of a brooch pin, the capital of an early ecclesiastical archway,
the illumination of a <span class="smcapuc">MS.</span>, or the graving of a piece of warlike furniture.”
An example of this kind of decoration is shown on <a href="#plate32">plate
<span class="smcapuc">XXXII.</span>, fig. 1</a>; it is the leg bone of a deer, 8½ inches long, highly
polished, and covered with carvings; its precise use is as yet conjectural.

amulets, or in some kind of game. According to Wilde, however,
their more probable use was either for the decoration of small
caskets, or for dress fasteners. They are generally perforated in
several places, and the foregoing illustrations display great variety
of outline. Their outer surface, smooth and convex, was more or
less decorated with a number of circular indentations and dotted
lines. Most of the specimens were found in the crannogs of
Ballinderry and Ardakillen.</p>

<span class="smcapuc">XXXIII.</span>, 1</a>, a piece of pottery (¼ size) that seems to have formed part
of an earthen vessel; it is coarse, strong, well made, and graceful
in design; other fragments were met with, and judging from the
appearance of fire on the outside of one, it had been used for cooking
purposes. <a href="#plate33">2.</a> A remarkable object of granite (½ size); two of
similar form were found at Ballykinler crannog. <a href="#plate33">3.</a> A paddle or
oar made of oak, its length 3 feet 7 inches by 4½ inches in breadth.
<a href="#plate33">4.</a> A wooden scoop; total length 12 inches, the handle 4 inches,
thickness 1½. <a href="#plate33">5.</a> A wooden vessel found with a canoe; its diameter
7 inches, depth 3, and thickness 1 inch; it would be adapted for
baling out a boat. <a href="#plate33">6</a> seems to be a netting needle (½ size); it is
made of iron. <a href="#plate33">7.</a> A battle-axe; length from face to end of projection
at back 7 inches, length of face 5½ inches, breadth 1 inch
at the one end, and at the other 1½ inches. <a href="#plate33">8.</a> Iron sock of a

<p>The following objects are all drawn one-half size:&mdash;<a href="#plate33">9.</a> A
knife, the only specimen met with at Ballykinler crannog, having
a handle. The haft is of goat’s horn, and the blade like
a penknife of large size; it does not seem applicable to any
ordinary domestic purpose, but it may have been used for bleeding
or operating on animals. <a href="#plate33">10.</a> A wooden instrument&mdash;of
which two were found&mdash;made of soft, long-grained wood of the
pine kind; they might have been used for coarse knitting. <a href="#plate33">11.</a> An
instrument of similar wood, use unknown. <a href="#plate33">12.</a> There were several
like <a href="#plate33">No. 12</a>, formed of soft wood; they might have served as fastenings
for mantle or hair. <a href="#plate33">13.</a> An instrument of bone, neatly made
and polished, which might have been used as a pin. <a href="#plate33">14.</a> A pin,
made of a close-grained, hard, white wood, probably holly; several
of these were brought to light. <a href="#plate33">15.</a> An article of iron, use unknown.
<a href="#plate33">16.</a> A pin of iron; several of these were found. <a href="#plate33">17, 18,

resembling <a href="#plate33">No. 17</a>, also several of <a href="#plate33">No. 19</a>. <a href="#plate33">24.</a> A large button
made of bronze; the eyes are not fastened in but cast. <a href="#plate33">25.</a> A crucible,
seemingly of foreign manufacture, and unused; but several
were met with greatly calcined. <a href="#plate33">26, 27, 28</a>, seem to be fastenings
for leather or other garments; they are of very thin bronze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
<a href="#plate33">29</a> is a comb made of bone and riveted with iron (found at Ballykinler
crannog).</p>

<p><a href="#plate34">Plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXIV.</span>, 1</a>, is a pointed and socketed iron instrument from
Ballymena. <a href="#plate34">2</a>, drawn about half-size, is evidently a lamp of late,
or perhaps mediæval form, composed of iron, and the workmanship
good; it had an upright handle pierced by an oblong hole,
with another hole in a projection at end of handle. A gentleman
saw a lamp of this class in use near Carrickfergus in the year 1840,
as also in the islands off the coast of Ulster. <a href="#plate34">3</a> is a canoe paddle
made of oak, and about 3 feet in length; <a href="#plate34">4</a> is of stone, and was
found in a crannog in the county Down; <a href="#plate34">5</a> is a “spindle-whorl”
(so called) made of jet, and having indentations on it for a thong
or string; <a href="#plate34">6</a> is a flint knife (full size); the form is rather unusual,
flint knives being generally straight; <a href="#plate34">7</a> is a full-size representation
of the smallest of two bronze knives; the other differs from
it in being 1 inch longer, and the shape not so curved; it should
however be observed, that these two articles are supposed by some
authorities to be modern forgeries. <a href="#plate34">8</a> is a bronze instrument about
6 inches long, and very sharp at the point; the metal and workmanship
being similar to the knives, it therefore may also be
spurious. <a href="#plate34">9.</a> A lozenge-shaped “spindle-whorl” of jet. This and
the three preceding are said to have come from Lough Guile. <a href="#plate34">10</a> is
a stone, natural size, perforated with two holes crossing at right
angles, and at each end a hole going a short way in. It is suggested
that it may have been the axis of a small wheel, “the
arms being inserted through the holes in the body of the stone,
while it worked on two projections inserted into the holes at the
ends.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>All the articles figured on <a href="#plate35">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXV.</span></a> were found in the crannog
of Cloonfinlough, and are now in the British Museum. <a href="#plate35">No. 1</a>
(one-fourth real size) represents a leaf-shaped dagger, skean, or
knife, of an extremely early type; it is a characteristic specimen
of its class. Similar weapons have, in Ireland, frequently occurred
in company with socketed celts, paalstaves, spear-heads, and other
implements of the so-called “Bronze Age.” The handle is very
small, perforated for insertion of a rivet, and probably the haft
had been originally prolonged by the addition of a piece of bone,
horn, or wood, secured to the bronze by means of the rivet. <a href="#plate35">No. 2</a>
(full-size) is an <i>eo</i> or brooch of bronze of a not unusual design,
having a long pin and broad flat ends, with a sunk lozenge in
each, filled with a hatched pattern. This form of dress-fastener
must have remained unchanged during many ages, for whilst it
seems to have been common in the later “Iron period,” it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> also
occasionally been found under circumstances which point to much
earlier days and usages. One example was discovered in a cinerary
urn amongst calcined bones. <a href="#plate35">No. 3</a> (full-size) is a pin of
bronze with a crozier-like termination, ornamented with a series of
minute indentations, arranged without any regular pattern. A
number of these objects have been discovered in Christian cemeteries
in Ireland&mdash;as at Clonmacnoise and the Arran Islands.
<a href="#plate35">No. 4</a> (full-size) is a very small arrow-head of iron; traces of a
rivet hole are yet discernible. <a href="#plate35">No. 5</a> (one-third real size) is a ring
made from the crown of a stag’s horn, and polished on the interior;
its use unknown. <a href="#plate35">No. 6</a> (one-third real size) represents a
double-bladed axe-head; similar implements occurred at Lagore
and at Drumdarragh; they belong to the late “Iron period,” and
vary greatly in dimensions. <a href="#plate35">No. 7</a> (one-third real size) is a single-piece
shoe of leather, joined at the heel and toe; at each side is a
slit for a thong or strap to be brought over the instep. Articles
of this kind were used amongst the Irish down to a very late
period. Some specimens, highly decorated in early Celtic style,
have been figured by Wilde.</p>

<p><i>Fishing Implements.</i>&mdash;It is probable that on account of the smallness
of their size, many bronze fishing-hooks may have been overlooked
by searchers amongst crannog sites, though a number of
specimens formed of iron occurred amongst the relics of ancient
Dublin during the excavations made many years ago in Christ
Church-place, and Fishamble-street. Several implements of iron,
evidently designed for the capture of fresh-water prey, have been
found on the sites of crannogs, and may now be seen in the Museum,
R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A. <a href="#plate36">Plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXVI.</span> No. 1</a> is the head of an eel-spear, one of
several exhumed from the debris of the Ardakillen crannogs; no
trace of the handle remained. The implement consists of nine barbed
prongs (the wings of the heads nearly touching each other) set in
an oblong-shaped socket, composed of extremely thin iron plates
or bands, that measure in width 5½ inches, in depth 2¾ inches, and
are of sufficient strength to receive and secure the prongs; these
average somewhat less than a quarter of an inch at their greatest
diameter, which occurs near the head. The socket in its various
parts is secured together by a number of rivets, irregularly set;
from it descends a shaft measuring 4¾ inches. It is at first quadrangular,
but midway assumes a cylindrical form, resembling
sockets of crannog spears of the later “iron peri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>od,” and like
them secured to wooden handles by a rivet. The implement presents
altogether a rough and bizarre appearance. <a href="#plate36">No. 2</a> is a smaller
example of an eel-spear, with socket, and having only eight barbed
prongs. <a href="#plate36">No. 3</a> is another form of fish-spear, or gaff. It measures
9½ inches in length, and is furnished at its pointed head with two
long narrow barbs designed for holding. Unlike the spear and
arrow-heads used in war, or in the chase, this implement was
secured to its wooden shaft by a tang. <a href="#plate36">Nos. 4, 5, 7, and 8</a>, are
darts or spear-heads of the same class. Save in size, they differ
very slightly from <a href="#plate36">No. 3</a>, but are considerably eroded by the moisture
of the bog-stuff in which they were embedded. <a href="#plate36">No. 6</a> is a highly-finished
head of the fish-spear class, though at first sight it might
almost be taken for an arrow-head. Its barbs were, however,
evidently intended to hold any substance into which they might
be struck; the tang is solid and octangular, and just at the point
where it joins the head there are three rather deep transverse
notches. <a href="#plate36">No. 9</a> is an ordinary iron fish-hook.</p>

<p><a name="HISTORICAL_NOTICES" id="HISTORICAL_NOTICES"></a><i>Historical Notices of Crannogs.</i>&mdash;According to Keller, Swiss
“<i>Pfahlbauten</i>,” or pile dwellings, attained their highest development
about fifteen hundred years <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> This statement he founds
on the absence in them of traces of winter corn, hemp, and domestic
fowl (unknown to the Greeks till the time of Pericles).
These lacustrine sites appear to have been abandoned about, or
perhaps before, the commencement of the Christian era; whilst on
the other hand, although we have no account of the first erection of
crannogs in Ireland, and must therefore consider their origin to
date back from prehistoric times, yet we have undoubted proofs of
their continued use down to the close of the seventeenth century;
although now where</p>

<p class="noindent">In Connaught, next after Ulster, the greatest number of lake
dwellings have been discovered, but a list of them could have only
temporary value, as further explorations might greatly change, or
even reverse, the numerical superiority of the crannog sites in
Ulster. It is only of late that Munster can be said to be embra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>ced
within the lake-dwelling area, whose ambit now includes the entire
kingdom. From the present stand-point, the northern province,
however, seems to have been <i>facile princeps</i> the home of the
lake-dweller. Its population, even to the close of the seventeenth
century, followed a life of rude and primitive character. The waters
of the Erne, its tributaries and lakes, stretched for a distance of
nearly sixty miles; the counties of Monaghan and Cavan of the
present day formed then a district of low wooded hills, interlaced
with a perfect net-work of bogs and lakes, through which ran but
one road&mdash;that by Carrickmacross in the barony of Farney&mdash;whilst
the Few mountains, at that period wooded, served to complete a
“scientific frontier” of nature’s own formation. The term “Lake
Country” has often been applied to the county Fermanagh: indeed
the whole territory would seem at no very remote date to
have been a watery maze. Upon almost every side may be observed
either marshes that had once been lakes, or else sheets of
water varying in size, from what may be termed lakes to mere
lakelets; and at a period when the whole neighbouring country
was one mass of wood these inland loughs served as tolerably secure
retreats. At the time of the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland
castles on terra firma seem to have been but lightly esteemed by
the northern chieftains, for the conqueror of Ulster had erected
many strongholds to secure the subjugated territory, more especially
in the country of Mac Mahon, who “with solemn protestations
vowed to become a true and faithful subject, whereupon
de Courcy gave him two castles with their demeanes to hold of
him. Within one month after this Mac Mahon brake down the
castles, and made them even with the ground. Sir John de Courcy
sent unto him to know the cause: his answer was, that he promised
not to hold stones of him, but the land.” Later on one Thomas
Pettiplace, in answer to an inquiry from the Government as to what
castles or forts O’Neil was possessed of, in a letter of the 15th
May, 1567, states:&mdash;“For castles I think it be not unknown unto
y<sup>r</sup> honors he trusteth no points thereunto for his safety, as appeareth
by the raising (<i>razing</i>) of the strongest castles of all his
countries, and that fortification that he only dependeth upon <i>is in
sartin ffreshwater loghes</i> in his country, which from the sea there
come neither ship nor boat to approach them; it is thought that
there in y<sup>e</sup> said <i>fortified islands</i> lyeth all his plate, w<sup>ch</sup> is much, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>money, prisoners, and gages, w<sup>ch</sup> islands hath in wars before been
attempted, and now of late again by y<sup>e</sup> Lord Deputy S<sup>r</sup> Harry
Sydney, w<sup>ch</sup>, for want of means for safe conduct upon y<sup>e</sup> water, it
hath not prevailed.” Of the unsuccessful attack on the crannog or
stockaded island, to which allusion is thus made, the account forwarded
by Sir Henry Sydney to Elizabeth, dated Drogheda, 12th
November, 1566, is here given:&mdash;“On Thursday, the 17th of the
last September, I, your Highnes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>s’ Deputy, accompanied with the
Earl of Kildare, the Marshal Francis Agarnde and Jaques Wingefelde,
with the rest of the captains and soldiers of your Highness’
army&mdash;each man in his calling as willing to serve your Majesty as
ever I saw men&mdash;issued out of this town of Drogheda, and encamped
in the confines of the English Pale and O’Hanlon’s
country, at a place called Roskeaghe, where we were forced to
remain, for sundry necessary things not come as then out of the
English Pale, four nights. So, on the 21st of the same month,
we removed and marched towards Ardmach, and in the way, having
occasion to encamp hard by a logh, in which was an island, and
in the same, by universal opinion and report of divers of that
country, a great quantity of the rebels’ goods and victuals kept,
only without guns, as it was thought, not greatly strong as it
seemed, being but hedged about, and the distance from the main
not being passed five-score yards, the army coming timely to the
camp, divers soldiers were very desirous to attempt the winning of
it, which was granted to them, I the Deputy making choice only
of such as could swim; nevertheless there was prepared for them
a bridge which floated upon barrels, whereupon they went but
disorderly, for many more went than were appointed, among whom
Edward Vaughan, a gentleman of Wales, who being none of the
army, but come over to serve this journey, as many more gentlemen
and others of that country and the marches of the same did,
was one who, unwitting to me your Highness’ Deputy, being gone
from the place where the bridge did lie, to stay the shot of the
army, least they should hurt their followers, with divers others not
appointed, stepped upon the bridge and rowed away, which overcharge
of men caused the bridge more to sink than else it would,
and yet not so much but that it floated still and carried them over,
but in such sort as the fireworks conveyed with them miscarried, so
they were able therewith to do nothing. They found the place
better manned than it was thought, and they of better courage
than before that time the like men had ever shewed themselves in
the like place. They found the hedge so bearded with stakes and
other sharp wood, as it was not without extreme difficulty scaleable,
and so ramparted as if the hedge had been burned&mdash;for doing
whereof the fireworks failed&mdash;without a long time it was not to
be digged down. Yet some scaled to the top, whereof Edward
Vaughan was one, who being pushed with a pike from the same,
fell between the hedge and the bridge, and being heavily armed&mdash;albeit
he could swim perfect well&mdash;was drowned, and two others
hurt upon the rampart and drowned; one other slain upon the
bridge with a shot; a man of mine, the Deputy, slain upon the
main with a shot; and Anthony Deringe, a servant of the
Earl of Leycester’s, stricken through the thigh without perishing
any bone, and is perfectly recovered; the rest, unhurt, returned
upon the bridge to the land. We write of this trifle thus largely
to your Most Excellent Majesty least some malice or ignorance
might inform the same contrary to the truth; and as many of us
as were at the journey by these our letters affirm this to be the
truth, and the whole truth, of that fact.”</p>

<p>Extracts that here follow, from notices of crannogs contained in
native annals,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> trace back their existence in Ireland during a period
of over a thousand years from the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>After the surrender of Charlemont, Sir Phelim O’Neil “retired
to a fortified island called <i>Raghan</i> (? Roughan) <i>Isle</i>, and was there
captured in February, 1653, by William Lord Charlemont.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>A small lake situated somewhat to the north-west of the village
of Desertmartin has given title to the barony of Loughinsholin,
lying south of the city of Londonderry; it was so named from
<i>Inis Ua Fhloinne</i> (O’Lynn’s Island), a stockaded dwelling near its
eastern margin. The lake itself is now known as Lough Shillen.
The oak piling that formerly surrounded the island was removed
for firewood, leaving a mere bank covered with reeds and low
bushes. In Father O’Mellan’s Journal (written in Irish) of the
rebellion of 1642, he mentions two attacks on the island by the
English, in the years 1642, 1643; and again in 1645, its final
abandonment and destruction by fire on the part of the Irish,
owing to inability to hold out from want of provisions. He st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>ates
that on the “27th April, 1642, the Coleraine detachment (<i>i.e.</i> the
English) came upon Cormac O’Neill, son of Fedhlim Oge, at
Rayleagh, and robbed and killed his people, namely the Clann
William; thence they proceeded to <i>Lough-inis-olyn</i>, and to
Moneymore, until the two forces were near one another. They
collected a great deal of spoil, and the creaghts fled to Dungannon.
After plundering far and near, the English returned to Lough-inis-olyn.
They sent Rory Ballagh O’Mellan to demand the
island from Shane O’Hagan, son of John, son of Edmond Oge. It
was refused them. They then fired three shots from a cannon,
which they had with them, and departed from the place, returning
to their homes laden with spoil.”</p>

<p>Again, on “August 25, 1643, Inis-O’Luin was garrisoned by
Shane O’Hagan. The enemy came and called on them to surrender,
which they refused to do. They then stopped up a stream
which ran out of the lake, and turned the course of another into
it, so that they contrived to flood the island. The garrison kept
watch in the island house, and one of their men was killed by a
cannon ball while on watch. However, they refused to surrender
the island on any terms. One man in attempting to swim away
had his legs broken. The enemy at length departed.” The latest
entry occurs under date 7th March, 1645, when “The people of
O’Hagan burned Inis-O’Lynn, for want of provisions, and followed
the general eastwards.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>The crannog of <i>Mac Navin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> county Galway, was taken in the
year 1610; it is previously mentioned under date 1601. G. H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Kinahan, who searched for but could find no trace of this crannog,
imagined its site must have been somewhere in the large alluvial
flat and bog that extends south of the townland of Crannagh, in the
parish of Tynagh, county Galway. This supposed site lies about
four miles E.N.E. of the crannog of Ballinlough. The difficulty
experienced in identifying the site is the more remarkable as the
descendants of the sept of Mac Navin still reside in the locality,
and the crannog was inhabited up to a very late period.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> In 1603,
after the subjugation of Leitrim by the Crown, “O’Rourke was
obliged to remain with a small force in the woods, in the remote
glens and on the islands in the lakes in his country;” whilst the
same year Hugh Boy O’Donnell was conveyed by his adherents to
the retirement of a crannog, to be healed of his wounds. This
retreat, called “<i>Crannog-na-n-Duini</i>, in Ross Guill, in the Tuathas,”
was situated in the parish of Mevagh, county Donegal, between
Redhaven and Sheephaven. In 1599 the crannog of <i>Lough
Gur</i>, county Limerick, was taken from the “Queen’s people”
by the Earl of Desmond, then in rebellion against Elizabeth. Sir
George Carew relates that the Lord President of Munster, who
reconnoitred the crannog for the purpose of its recapture in the
following year, <i>i.e.</i> 1600, observed two small islets (the crannogs)
and one large island; this latter “he found to be a place of exceeding
strength, by reason that it was an island encompassed with
a deep lough, the breadth thereof being, in the narrowest place, a
caliver’s shot over. Upon one side thereof standeth a very strong
castle, which at this time was manned with a good garrison, for
there was within the island John Fitz Thomas with two hundred
men at the least.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> “After much parade in the preparation of
ordnance to reduce Lough Gur, its surrender was purchased for
sixty pounds from Owen Grome, who had been entrusted with its
defence.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> There yet lingers here “the reflex of a legend past,”
for it is supposed that beneath the waters of the lake lie enchanted
the grand old castle of the Desmonds, the great earl himself, his
beautiful countess, and all the retinue that surrounded him in the
days of his splendour. “In one of the lakes is a small island,
rocky and wooded, whic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>h is believed by the peasantry to represent
the top of the highest tower of the castle, which sank under a spell
to the bottom.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>In a plan-drawing of the siege of Enniskillen castle, in the year
1592, the remains of a crannog appear in the river close to the
castle, where seemingly a circle of stakes encloses a diminutive
island.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The survey or maps of the county Monaghan, made by
one Francis Jobson in 1590, though meagre, and certainly&mdash;as its
designer expresses in an apologetic note to Burghley&mdash;“nothing
perfect,” is nevertheless highly interesting by reason of the rude
sketches of the water-laved abodes of the chiefs of Monaghan.
Each barony possessed one, designated “the island”; that in
Farney was at <i>Lisanisk</i>, written <i>Lysonske</i>, and it is marked on
the map as “The Island, Ever M’Cooley’s house.” In the year
1843 traces of this structure were discovered; the former artificial
island was then a peninsula, having been joined to the shore.
Seven feet below the surface of the ground, and two feet below
the water level, a double row of piles was disclosed, formed of
young trees with the bark still adhering, and from six to twelve
inches in diameter; the area thus enclosed was an oval sixty feet
by forty-two feet.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> In Jobson’s map several crannogs are represented
in <i>Lough Mucknoe</i>, barony of Cremorne; also “Mac Mahoun’s
house,” or crannog, is shown in <i>Lough Monnachin</i>. According
to the same authority, a sub-chief of the present county
Monaghan, named Mac Kenna, resided in a crannog either on
the lake of <i>Glaslough</i> or that of <i>Erny</i> in the parish of Donagh.
The map is so rough that it is difficult to decide which of the
lakes is intended. Francis Jobson likewise represents the residence
of a chieftain named Brian Mahon, as a crannog on <i>Lough
Rouskey</i>, in the parish of Killeevan. In 1588 Aedh O’Donnell
and nine of his followers were murdered in the crannog of <i>Mongavlin</i>,
parish of Taughboyne, county Donegal. “The crannog
is not now traceable, nor is there any water in the locality in
which such a structure could have existed, with the exception of
Lough Foyle, on the margin of which Mongavlin is situated.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
In 1571 the Mac Dermots burned <i>Inis-Floinn</i> and <i>Inis-Mi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>c-David</i>,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
situated somewhere on the borders of Roscommon and Sligo. The
statement that the islands were burned seems to sufficiently demonstrate
their artificial character. In the sixteenth century the
island fortress of <i>Inishrush</i> was held by an Irish sub-chief named
Brian Carragh; and Dr. Reeves quotes a document from the
State Paper Office, in which allusion is made to it in the form of a
letter to a Captain Piers, dated 10th December, 1566. The writer
says:&mdash;“Als mony as we migt drywe and dreaf ower ye Ban all
y<sup>e</sup> carycht y<sup>t</sup> Brean Karriche hade … and ane innyse (i.e. <i>Island</i>,
namely <i>Inishrush</i>), y<sup>t</sup> Brean Karriche hade of befair and Oneiles
servand tuk y<sup>t</sup>, and now we have gotten y<sup>e</sup> innys agane, and that
harchips I behuffit to Sla yame to be meet to my arme.” The
crannog of Inishrush (<i>i. e.</i> the island of the wood), or perhaps,
peninsula, has long ceased to bear that name. It is a small island
in the middle of a marshy basin called Green Lough, in the townland
of Inishrush, barony of Loughinsholin, county Derry. Some
years ago this marsh was a sheet of water about half a mile in
circumference, the drainage of which was effected by means of a
deep cut that carried its contents into the Clady river. About the
centre of the lakelet was a circular artificial mound composed of
clay and gravel, the sides gradually shelving downwards. It was
girt with a circle&mdash;about one hundred and fifty feet in circumference&mdash;of
oak piles, most of them still in position. Horizontal
beams of oak were mortised in the upper ends, and upon this
framework rested seemingly the foundation of a wooden house
securely attached to the supporting timbers. An artificial causeway,
leading from the western margin of the lough, appears to
have formerly connected the crannog with terra firma. The sole
discovery made was a fragment of chain-armour. The lake basin
became again partly submerged owing to neglect of the drainage,
and when Dr. Reeves visited the locality in 1859, he failed to
reach the crannog. It remained, however, above water, prominently
covered with a luxuriant growth of grass.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>In 1560 O’Rourke was drowned “whilst going to sleep on
a low sequestered crannog in <i>Muinter Eolius</i>,” county Leitrim.
Under heading of the year 1544, crannogs in the county Antrim
are referred to in the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>:&mdash;“O’Donnell
marched with a force into the Routes, and took (i.) <i>Ini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>s-an-Lochain</i>,
on which was a wooden castle and an impregnable fortress
in the possession of Mac Quillan; and after O’Donnell had taken
the castle he gave the castle to O’Kane. On the same expedition
O’Donnell took the castle of (ii.) <i>Baile-an-locha</i>, and he found much
property, consisting of arms, armour, brass, iron, butter and provisions,
in those castles. O’Donnell also took after that (iii.) <i>Inis-locha-Burrann</i>,
and (iv.) <i>Inis-locha-Leithinnsi</i>, in which he likewise
found much property.” (i.) <i>Inis-an-Lochain</i> (<i>i. e.</i> the island of the
little lake) lies in the river Bann, about a mile and a-half to the
south of Coleraine. It is now called Loughan Island. The crannog
had been erected, or perhaps, <i>re</i>-erected in 1170. (ii.) <i>Baile-an-locha</i>
(<i>i. e.</i> the village of the lake), anglicised Ballylough, and
(iv.) <i>Locha-Leithinnsi</i> (<i>i. e.</i> the lake of the half island), now known
as Lough Lynch, are both situated in the parish of Billy. Lough
Lynch originally covered about twenty acres, but has been drained,
and the former island is now accessible by dry land. This crannog
“is shown as the birthplace of Colkitto, a chief who figured in
Montrose’s wars,” and who has found a place in Sir Walter Scott’s
“Legend of Montrose,” as well as in one of Milton’s sonnets,
written on the critics who cut up the title of his book “Tetrachordon:”&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">Colkitto’s real name was Alexander Mac Donnell, a relative of
the Earl of Antrim. (iii.) <i>Inis-locha-Burrann</i> was situated in
the parish of Ballintoy; the lake is now drained, and the place
known by the name of Loughavarra.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>In 1541 the eastern crannog in the lake of Glencar, on the
borders of Sligo and Leitrim, was taken by one sept of the
O’Rourkes from another. Shortly afterwards the dispossessed
proprietor attempted to set fire to the “fortress,” but was
discovered, pursued by boats, taken prisoner, and hanged. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>n the
summer of 1540, O’Donnell besieged the crannog of <i>Loch Betha</i>,
now Lough Veagh, county Donegal. He encamped round the
lake shores, but failed to take the stronghold. In the autumn he,
however, defeated his opponents, and “broke up and completely
demolished the crannog.” Previous mention is made of it as the
scene of strife in the year 1524, when Eoghan O’Donnell took
Niall O’Donnell’s “town” (<i>i.e.</i> the crannog of Loch Betha); whilst
in 1257 O’Donnell was confined to this crannog during twelve
months from wounds received in a battle near Sligo. In 1512
the crannog of Mac Gauran was taken by Mac Guire. In 1495
Mac Gauran, a chief of Tallaghaw, in the present county Cavan,
was drowned in <i>Loch Crannoige</i> of <i>Coill-an-mhuilinn</i> (<i>i. e.</i> Lake
Crannog of the Wood of the Mill), now Ballywillen Lough. In
1477 a violent tempest swept over Ireland which did great damage,
especially to crannogs. Had these structures not been very numerous,
the chroniclers would scarcely have drawn special attention
to the havoc thus wrought. In 1455 Torlogh Mac Guire
took and plundered the crannog of Mac Clancy on Lough Melvin,
county Leitrim. In 1452 O’Hanley was murdered by his own
tribe in the crannog of <i>Loch-Leisi</i> (stated by O’Donovan to be
now called Muckenagh Lough), in the parish of Kilmeam, county
Roscommon; whilst in 1246 it is of record that O’Conor made his
escape when a prisoner from the same lake-dwelling, after drowning
his guards. In 1368 an O’Conor was taken prisoner in the crannog
of <i>Ardakillen</i>, parish of Killukin, county Roscommon, and in
1388 another O’Conor burned this crannog and the Island of <i>Loch-Cairgin</i>
(<i>i. e.</i> Cargin’s Lough<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>), near Tulsk in the same county.
In 1365 Brian Mac Mahon, chief of Oriel, invited his father-in-law
to a banquet, where he made him prisoner, and “put him in
a lake to conceal him”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>&mdash;evidently meaning his confinement in a
crannog&mdash;for Mac Geoghegan states that the captive was committed
“to a strong place on a lough to be kept.” In 1247 Mac Costello
took and garrisoned the crannog of <i>Cloonloch</i> (now Lough Clean),
county Leitrim, and expelled the proprietor, Mac Rannall, who,
however, succeeded in recapturing his stronghold.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1223 William de Lacy, one of the great Anglo-Norman
settlers in Ireland erected “the crannog of <i>Inis-Laodhachain</i>, and
the Connacht men entered forcibly upon it, and let out on parole
the people who were in it.” This erection of a lake-dwelling by a
Norman baron is an instance of the habit laid to the charge of
many of the English, of forsaking their own language and usages,
and of living according to the manner of the Irish amongst whom
they dwelt. “The names <i>Inis-Laodhachain</i> and <i>Loch-Laodhachain</i>
are now obsolete.” In 1220 “Walter de Laci came to Erinn, and
performed a great hosting to the crannog of O’Raighilligh.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> He
went upon it and obtained hostages and great power.” The crannog
here referred to “appears to have been situated in Lough
Oughter, county Cavan, where the old castle of Cloch-Uachtair
(or Cloch-Oughter) now stands. In a letter from Guy de Chatillon
to Henry III., dated July, 1224, Grennoch Oraely (as the
name is therein written) is stated to have been captured from
William de Lacy by Oraely, Walter de Riddelsford, and Richard
Tuit, on the same day on which the castle of Kilmore (county
Cavan) was taken, from which it appears to have been in the
neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>There is evidence that some crannogs were constructed by the
Northmen, for in 1170 the chief of a small territory in the barony
and county Monaghan “was killed by the men of a fleet which
came from the Orkneys, in the island which had been constructed
by themselves in <i>Loch-Ruidhe</i>, i. e. Inis-Lachain.” There is no
lake in Ireland now known by that name; but to the south of
Coleraine there is a small island in the river Bann called “the
Loughan,” which bears all the appearance of having been artificially
constructed.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> In 1150 an Irish chief was killed “on the
island of <i>Loch-Laighaire</i>.” This crannog lay in the country of
the “<i>Sliocht O’Neills</i>,” and, as appears from subsequent references,
was situated to the south of Lifford, in the barony of Clogher,
county Tyrone, and was the residence of that branch of the O’Neills.
It is written <i>Loch-Laoghaire</i> and <i>Loch-Laighaire</i>, i. e.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> Leary’s
Lake, said to have been so called from “Leary the Victorious,” one
of the heroes of the Red Branch Knights of Ulster, in the first
century; but for nearly two hundred years it has been generally
known under the designation <i>Corcreevy</i>, i. e. wooded hill. In
1845, when the water had been drained off, the crannog was here
discovered. There are several allusions to it in the Irish Annals.
In 1325 “O’Donnell, the son of Brian O’Neill, Lord of Tyrone,
died at Loch-Laighaire. In 1431 Nachtan O’Donnell went to
assault the castle of Loch-Laighaire, and took it from Turlough
O’Donnell, and all the spoils that were in it he carried off.” In
1436 the crannog had been seized by the O’Neills, when some of
the same sept summoned Mac Guire to their assistance and “commenced
constructing boats to go to the crannog, but the sons of
Bryan, who were then in the crannog, came to the resolution of
delivering it up.” In 1500 Hugh Roe O’Donnell “burned the
crannog of Loch-Laighaire;” whilst in 1509 there is a notice of a
fight between two septs of the O’Neills on the shores of the lake.</p>

<p>In 1025, it is stated in the <i>Annals of Loch Cé</i>, that a predatory
expedition was made by the inhabitants of Fermanagh, on which
occasion they burned the crannog on <i>Loch-n-Uaithne</i> (Lough
Ooney), “and slew seventeen men on the margin of the lake.”
Lough Ooney lies in the county Monaghan, in the barony of Dartry,
the chiefs of which territory had their principal residence on this
lake, whence they were sometimes designated “Lords of Loch-n-Uaithne.”</p>

<p>In the enumeration of various kinds of fortresses repaired by
Brian Borumha, crannogs are included, as recorded in a well-known
Irish ms. entitled “The Wars of the Gaedhiel with the Gaill.”
In it mention is made of four crannogs, one being near Knockany,
county Limerick, and situated in <i>Lough Cend</i>, now drained; also
the celebrated crannog in <i>Lough Gur</i>, in the same county. The
site of the crannog of <i>Loch Saiglend</i> has not been identified;<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> the
site of <i>Inis-an-ghaill-duibh</i> (<i>i. e.</i> the island of the black foreigner or
Dane,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>) is unknown, or at least uncertain; however, in the Dublin
copy of the <i>Annals of Innisfallen</i>, under date 1016, it is stated to
have been situated in the river Shannon. We learn that in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
of his numerous conflicts with the Danes, Brian Borumha pillaged
various <i>islands</i> in the Shannon, where the invaders had placed
their women and children for safety, as well as their treasure, as
“there was much gold and other wealth in these islands and fortifications.”
In 990 a violent tempest “sunk the island of <i>Lough Cimbe</i>
(now Lough Hackett) suddenly, <i>dreach</i> and rampart, <i>i. e.</i> thirty
feet;” this crannog was afterwards rebuilt by Brian Borumha.</p>

<p>With the Danes, the struggle in Ireland between invaders and
invaded was carried on as much in the lakes and rivers as on terra
firma. Of the importance attached to crannogs during this contest
many instances might be given, but a few will here suffice.
In 984 “the islands of Connaught were destroyed by these marauders.”
In 933 the crannog of <i>Lagore</i> in Meath was burnt by
them; whilst in 848 they fired and dismantled it. Lagore being
the residence of one of the principal chiefs of Meath, frequent
notices of it appear in the annals, where it is written <i>Loch-Gabhar</i>.
“<i>Gabhur</i>” is an ancient Irish and British word for a horse, and
accordingly the name <i>Loch-gabhra</i>, which occurs in the life of St.
Aidus, is translated <i>Stagnum-equi</i>, the lake of the horse,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> now
euphonized “Lagore.” In 967 Beollán, “king” of this place,
died; in 907 Maelogra, also “king” of Lagore, was slain; whilst
in 868 the son of Edirscel, “king” of Lagore, fell fighting
against the Danes. In 865 Tighernach, “king” of Lagore and
“half-king” of Meath, died; and in 856 Cinaedh, chief of the
present baronies of Upper and Lower Duleek, in Meath, in alliance
with the Danes, “spoiled the islands” of Lagore. This entry
is of great importance, as it points to the probability of the site of
another crannog or crannogs in close proximity to the celebrated
historical stronghold dug out of its peaty covering in 1847, and
which as early as <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 673, must have been of importance, for in
that year a considerable battle took place on the shores of the lake.
In 927 and 928 the Danes plundered “the islands of Lough
Neagh,” and in 922 the same fate befel “the islands of Lough
Rea.”</p>

<p>In 847 “the island of <i>Inis-Muinremhar</i>,” in Lough Ramor,
county Cavan, was “demolished by the inhabitants of Leyney,
county Sligo, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> Gallen, county Mayo, who were plundering
the territories after the manner of the Gentiles.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> In 636 a chieftain
named Maelduin was burned to death in “the island” of
<i>Inishkeen</i>, county Louth, on the borders of Monaghan,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and in
the same year mention is made in the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>
of “a lake in which a crannog was built, situated in Oriel (but not
now known), called <i>Loch-da-damh</i>, the lake of the two oxen.”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>There is an ancient poem in Irish,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> attributed to St. Columbkille,
which commences&mdash;</p>

<p>A well-known Irish scholar, the Rev. Canon Bourke, gives the

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“If by six thousand I was guarded,</div>

<div class="verse">No man can slay me till the day</div>
<div class="verse">When God shall take my life away.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is said to be an ancient <i>Life of St. Patrick</i> which contains
a notice of one of those dwellings; and in a translation into
English of an ancient Irish ms., the “Pursuit of Diarmuid and
Grainne”&mdash;two characters belonging to the earliest, indeed generally
supposed mythic, period of Irish history&mdash;Fionn and Diarmuid
are represented as addressing each other, and the one calls <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>to mind
that Miodhach the son of Colgan, “had a Bruighean upon land,
and a Bruighean <i>upon the wave</i>” (<i>i. e.</i> an island). The word
Bruighean means a palace. The island upon which this structure
stood was, according to the text, situated upon the Shannon, and
was approached by a “ford.”</p>

<p>Thus can be clearly traced a continuous historical occupancy of
these structures until all written record of them ceases, and their
origin is lost in the mists of antiquity: enough proof has been
advanced to show that crannogs existed, as may be fairly surmised,
from the first colonization of Erin. In the most diverse climates
“water towns” seem to have sprung up independently, by virtue
of the natural laws which govern man’s action in a semi-civilized
state&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">Nec diversa tamen, qualis decet esse sororum.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The continuance in Ireland of this very primitive form of habitation
was doubtless prolonged in consequence of the restless internecine
feuds and generally unsettled state of the country.
However, the “silver streak” around the island homes of Ireland’s
early inhabitants was not always a secure barrier; during severe
winters, when the water was sufficiently frozen, it no longer presented
an obstacle, but on the contrary was of considerable assistance
to marauders. In the native chronicles most notices of
crannogs are connected with scenes of strife, the island of the
weaker party being usually given to the flames. A disturbed state
of society up to a very late period was also characteristic of the
sister kingdom of Scotland, and the antiquarian and poetical genius
of Sir Walter Scott brings the feuds of the past before the eyes of
the modern reader. The scene wherein the Lowlanders or Saxons
fruitlessly essay to reach the island on Loch Katrine, where the
Highlanders or Celts had placed their women, children, and goods
for safety, had most probably its foundation in some real occurrence.
In his <i>History of the Rise of the Dutch Republic</i>, Motley traces the
gradual development of what is now the kingdom of Holland,
from a race of ichthyophagi who dwelt upon mounds which they
raised like beavers above the almost fluid soil, but whether there
ever was in Erin a period purely lacustrine, or to what extent
villages on terra firma may have co-existed, is a problem that will
most probably never be solved. From careful examination, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
of the “finds” in lake dwellings, the conclusion may be
drawn that civilization in Ireland, from the earliest dawn, has
been on the whole steadily progressive, for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“… I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs,</div>
<div class="verse">And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is something in the continuity of these successive ages that
may be considered analogous to the connecting links of a chain.
The Palaeolithic, or rude stone period; the Neolithic, or polished
stone age, as well as the Bronze age, in all probability overlapped
more, and had a longer continuance, than elsewhere in Europe.
But the mere fact of the discovery of stone implements, particularly
as in Ireland, in a stone-producing country, is not necessarily
proof of a barbarous state of society, for, as remarked by the Duke
of Argyll, the remains of the first Chaldean monarchy plainly demonstrate
that a high state of civilization co-existed with the use
of stone implements of a very rude character.</p>

<h3><a name="PROVINCE_OF_ULSTER" id="PROVINCE_OF_ULSTER"></a>PROVINCE OF ULSTER.</h3>

<h4>COUNTY ANTRIM.</h4>

<p><i>Lough Ravel</i> (otherwise Derryhollagh).&mdash;This name is but a
modern corruption of the ancient form, found in the Inquisition
of 1605 to be in the district of the “Feenagh”:&mdash;“Est in eodem
tuogh quidam lacus vocatus Loughdireare in quo est insula fortificata.”
The site of this crannog, lying between Toomebridge and
Randalstown, is known to the country people as “the island” in
Aghaloughan bog; it seems to have been entirely artificial, constructed
on oak piles driven into the bed of the lough, and bound
together by horizontal beams of the same timber mortised to the
piles. The interior was filled up with wood and earth, thus forming
an island of about twenty-eight yards in diameter; and beyond
this, at the distance of some six or eight yards, there still
remain several oaken piles, probably traces of an outer stockade.
On the crannog were stone hearths with marks of fire on them,
and partially within the enclosure was a very perfect single-piece
canoe of oak, twenty feet nine inches long, by four feet seven inches
broad, the sides twenty inches deep. In the island and its immediate
vicinity were querns, several wooden and copper dishes,
daggers and spear-heads of bronze, iron celts, and stones with
holes perforated in them; also some articles seemingly intended
for ornamental purposes, and others of strange shape, regarding
the use of which no conjecture can be formed. These “finds”
have been sold from time to time to various collectors. At a
short distance from the island, and twelve feet below the surface
of the bog, was brought to light in the summer of 1856, a pan-shaped
circular vessel of thin hammered copper, twenty-two inches
in diameter, and eight inches in depth; it is now in the B<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>elfast
Museum, and a label attached to it states that a few years previously
a similar one had been found nearer to the island; and in
1859 another vessel of small size, made of hammered copper, was
discovered in the same locality. A bronze needle or bodkin, three
inches long, with the eye quite perfect; a narrow iron hatchet,
eight inches in length, and one and a-half inches wide at its cutting
edge;<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> a bronze pin of unusual form, ornamented with two
human heads (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_109">109</a>, <a href="#fig126">fig. 126</a>); two bronze fibulæ (<i>ante</i>, p.
<a href="#Page_118">118</a>, figs. <a href="#fig147">147</a> and <a href="#fig148">148</a>); undressed flint flakes (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_58">58</a>, figs.

<p><i>Loughmagarry.</i>&mdash;The townland of this name is in the parish of
Craigs, barony of Toome lower; it contains within it a low-lying
piece of land, the former bed of a lake that was drained towards
the close of the last century. The present name bears no resemblance
to its designation in the Inquisition of 1605,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> but it has
been identified as the same by Dr. Reeves; the large townland
which adjoins it on the west, and of which it appears to have been
formerly a sub-denomination, is called Feenagh. The Loughinchefeaghny
of the deed of 1605 is a compound word, signifying&mdash;according
to the above authority&mdash;“the lake of the island of
Feenagh,” but perhaps may be interpreted the island of Fiodhnach,
<i>i. e.</i> the wooded place. The crannog stood close to the shore
of the lake near its western margin, where the bank rises abruptly
from the hollow; it is now a mere gravelly knoll, but the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
people recollected seeing it surrounded with an external framing
of oak posts, the interior filled in with gravel and clay. Several
curiosities (now dispersed) are said to have been found in it.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p><i>Loughtamand</i>, or <i>Loughtarmin</i>.&mdash;In the townland of Lisnahunshin,
parish of Craigs, barony of Toome lower, and four miles
N. W. of the village of Ahoghill, a crannog became apparent about
1849, when the lake was drained. According to the description
given by labourers employed in the operations, a kind of framework,
consisting of oaken beams in a good state of preservation,
was discovered, entirely surrounding an island. Local tradition
assigns this stronghold to the sept of the Mac Quillans, and being
situated on the boundary of the districts of Dalaradia and Dalrieda,
it afforded great security as a place of retreat, after marauding
expeditions&mdash;a recommendation that in ancient times would
render it a position of considerable importance. Its site was identified
by Dr. Reeves as the “Loughtoman” mentioned in the
Inquisition of 1605: “Est in eodem le tuogh quidam lacus sive
stagnum vocatum Loughtoman in quo est insula fortificata.” The
lough is bordered on the east and south by traces of bog, and enclosed
on the north and west by hills three in number, from two
of which the country slopes down with a regular fall to the river
Bann. Between the hills on the north and north-west there is a
considerable depression, and at this point a small stream flowed,
carrying off the surface water, and which stream, being deepened,
served as a drain for the lough. Before the withdrawal of its contents,
about fifty acres were submerged, the water varying in depth
from seven to ten feet. In the year 1820 the lough was drained
by Lord O’Neil, but from after neglect the water once more accumulated
in the hollow; it was, however, again drained, and is now
under pasture. On the east side the banks of the bog which
formed the margin were from twenty to thirty feet in perpendicular
height, the outline of the basin being thus well defined; it
was of irregular oval shape, and about a mile in circumference.
The island itself, of circular form, and seventy yards in diameter,
was situated almost in the centre, though somewhat nearer to the
north and east sides; it was visible even before the drainage, and
on it was a stone house. In the draining operations the main cut
was carried across the long diameter of the lough from south-eas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>t
to north-west, passing through the middle of the island, where the
workmen came upon oak piles. These piles&mdash;from seventeen to
twenty feet long, and from six to eight inches thick&mdash;were driven
into the bed of the lough, and projected five or six feet above it;
they were bound together at the top by horizontal oak beams, into
which they were mortised and secured by stout wooden pegs.
Above the top of these piles there was a depth of three or four
feet of earth, and it was only when the earth had been removed
from time to time that the wooden structure became apparent in
its integrity. The piles&mdash;twenty-six in number&mdash;were arranged
in a circle of about fifteen yards in diameter in the centre of the
island, and just under where the stone house stood. It was stated
that a few feet below the present surface of the bed of the lough
a paved causeway of stone, about five feet broad, led from its
western margin across to the island, which is now reduced to the
level of the surrounding ground from the effects of cattle tramping
over it, and persons digging down in search of treasure. The
horizontal beams were removed and used for various purposes;
the drain formed a tangent to the circle of piles touching it on
the east, where some of them were dragged up on being laid bare.
A single-piece oak canoe, in tolerable preservation, was discovered
about thirty yards from the island on the north-west side, and
from time to time the following articles were found in it: metal
dishes; small axe-heads; two iron swords; a small anvil; a pair
of scale; many small hammers; “several gold pins;” an iron
cauldron of low dilated shape, and a stone yellowish-white in
colour, beautifully polished, about twelve inches long, three and
a-half inches broad, and two inches thick, accurately squared at
the sides, having at each end a round hole one and a-quarter inches
deep, and a-half inch in diameter, the top surface and one of the
sides being covered with carved devices. Lord O’Neil obtained
the swords; the anvil, scales, and hammers, were sold for trifling
sums to an itinerant dealer; the iron cauldron was in use as a potato
pot, and the polished stone was given by the finder to a friend
as a “rubbing-stone” for his web.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p><i>Kilknock.</i>&mdash;In the Ulster Inquisition sped at Antrim on the
12th July, 1605, which still remains of record, it was found,
amongst other things, by the jury, “Et quod est infra metas e<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>t
bundas ejusdem le tuogh quoddam stagnum vocatum Loughernegilly
in quo est insula fortificata.” Although that name is now
obsolete, yet Dr. Reeves, after careful research, succeeded in identifying
it with Kilknock lough situated in the north-west corner of
Drummaul, in the townlands of Kilknock, Ballybollen, and Gillistown.
In former times this lake covered fifty acres, but it was
drained about the close of the last century: by this means the
crannog was brought to light, and the oak piles on which it was
constructed were exposed to view. It is described as of nearly
circular shape, sixty feet in diameter, and on it were the remains
of a wooden hut, constructed of oak beams; these timbers were
removed, and some of them utilized as roofing material for a
neighbouring barn. A canoe was found (at the same time) in the
lough. Owing to a dispute, which afterwards arose, as to the
ownership of the drained land, the outlets of the water were allowed
to close up, and in consequence a considerable portion of
the former lake had become again submerged. The island could
be reached by wading, but was distinguishable from the rest of the
marsh only by its greater firmness. Over the tops of the oak piles&mdash;said
to be about two feet in diameter&mdash;was a considerable depth
of soft boggy matter, and a paved causeway, covered eight or nine
feet deep, led down to what used to be the edge of the water. The
bog around the lake, thickly studded with trunks of oak, varying
from one to three feet in diameter, prove it to have been at some
remote period the site of an extensive wood.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p><i>Randalstown.</i>&mdash;The large crannog in this locality appears to
have been formed with very heavy beams laid horizontally, but
its condition when discovered must render any account of the
original construction quite conjectural. The island is said to
have been formerly occupied by a sub-chief of the O’Neils; the
lake in which it stood was long since drained, and a peat-moss
now occupies the place. Many articles discovered in this crannog
are now dispersed; they would seem to have been of all ages, and
to have been deposited at varying intervals of time: a stone
hatchet of rather diminutive size, but in shape neither remarkable
nor uncommon, was probably the most ancient relic, and the most
modern was a base coin of Philip and Mary. The surrounding
bog has yielded up not merely several fragments of canoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> but
also some in an entire state. One of large size, and quite perfect,
was (in 1860) exhumed from a depth of sixteen feet of peat: when
first raised it retained its original shape, but from drying and atmospheric
exposure it soon warped and became shapeless. The
length of this canoe was about twenty feet by four feet wide at
the stern, and three feet at the stem; from thence for about two-thirds
of its length it was formed out of a single log, the stern end
being composed of thick short planks well fastened with strong
wooden pegs. In the bottom was a neatly made paddle of oak,
three and a-half feet long (<a href="#plate33">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXIII.</span>, No. 3</a>); beside it lay a
wooden bowl that would contain about a quart; it had been hollowed
out of a single piece of wood, and its sides were thick and
rough (<a href="#plate33">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXIII.</span>, No. 5</a>). Later on another canoe paddle of
oak was discovered measuring three feet in length (<a href="#plate34">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXIV.</span>,
No. 3</a>). A good idea of the importance of this stronghold may be
formed from the number of tools and appliances found in it for
carrying on the ordinary business of every-day life, such as the
tongs and supposed anvil of the smith&mdash;the latter a rough lump
of iron somewhat smoothed on one side, and weighing fifty or
sixty pounds&mdash;many crucibles, one unused, but several greatly
worn and burnt, the most perfect specimen being about the size of
a hen’s egg; a netting-needle of iron; a battle-axe, such as was
borne by the ancient gallowglasses; a very small sock of a plough
(<a href="#plate33">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXIII.</span>, Nos. 25, 6, 7, 8</a>), and an iron lamp (<a href="#plate34">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXIV.</span>,
No. 2</a>).<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p><i>Ballymena.</i>&mdash;At a distance of about four miles from this town,
and near Cloughwater, the site of a crannog was discovered in the
middle of a bog, formerly the basin of a lake, that had been filled
up by peat, which had grown to such an extent as to entirely bury
the island dwelling until laid bare by turf-cutters. Seemingly the
crannog was not of great size, neither did it contain objects of
special interest in themselves, their peculiarity being that instruments
of iron and stone were found in company, also a bronze pin
and several fragments of crucibles, together with remains of the
fuel used. A pointed and socketed iron instrument (<a href="#plate34">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXIV.</span>,
No. 1</a>); two small flint knives; a stone celt; a round flat stone,
two inches in diameter, having an oblong indentation on either
side; and several pieces of rude pottery, bearing marks of fire,
were amongst the articles brought to light.</p>

<p><i>Lough Guile.</i>&mdash;In the parish of same name, and on the site of
a crannog situated in a bog, are said to have been discovered two
bronze knives, and with them a bronze instrument, six inches
long and very sharp in the point (<a href="#plate34">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXIV.</span>, figs. 8 and 7</a>);
and on the same plate, <a href="#plate34">fig. 6</a>, is a flint knife, the form rather unusual:
there were several of the articles commonly called “spindle-whorls,”
some of lozenge shape, but most of them round; one
was composed of jet, having indentations on it as for a thong or
string. No description of the special formation of this crannog is
recorded.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Bronze Weapons from Crannog sites on Toome Bar.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Toome Bar.</i>&mdash;In 1864 Robert Day, junior, gave the following
interesting description of sites of crannogs in this neighbourhood.
The bridge which spans the river at Toome forms a connecting
link between the counties Antrim and Derry. At this place Lough
Neagh presents the appearance of a great V, having the space between
the points filled with a sand-bank, known as Toome bar,
and which is almost invariably covered with from two to three feet
of water. Barton, who published a work on Lough Neagh in
1751, states that before the autumnal season the water discharged
at Toome was so very inconsiderable as not to afford a depth
greater than that which may reach to the ankle or the knee of a
person wading, and that on one occasion a man, taking advantage
of an inblowing wind, walked over dryshod. Strewn upon the
bar, and imbedded in it, were logs and balks of timber, some
bearing the marks of fire, while others still retained their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> upright
position. They must have been placed there artificially, as the
bar of sand extends a quarter of a mile into the lake, outside of
which there is deep water, and if it were by the force of the water
they had been thrown up, it is equally probable they would have
been swept away by the first flood. From this it may be inferred
that there was on the spot, at a very remote period, a crannog or
lacustrine settlement. The large number of flint weapons found
on the surface, or imbedded in the sandy bottom, renders it more
than probable that they had been in use by the dwellers in this
island village. Flint is not found within seven miles of Toome,
so that it must have been carried to and manufactured in the crannog.
The most conclusive proof of their having been made on the
site was furnished by the presence of the large cores of flint from
which the weapons had been struck. Two rudely-shaped, barbed
spear-heads were here obtained, and four celts of the ordinary type,
made from the trap rock, two of them polished, but the others
were made with less care, the edge alone showing signs of careful
working. Antiquities of great variety belonging to the stone and
bronze periods were found at the time the river Bann was deepened;
these were deposited in the Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A. All the good
specimens, evidently designed for special purposes, and to which
had been given certain and definite shapes, were made out of rocks
characterised by possession of all the essential qualities needful for
such articles; whilst the rude, ill-formed implements were composed
of shale, slate, schist, grit, or any other stone which presented
itself within reach. The greater number of the flint weapons were
formed by not more, probably, than three or four skilful strokes,
thus: one would strike the fragment from the core, two more would
form the mid-rib giving it a leaf-shape, and a fourth stroke would
cause the slight depression at the base intended to secure the weapon
to its shaft or handle. These opaque flint flakes, of the largest
size and honey yellow in colour, were found six feet under the bed
of the river Bann, lying with several others and a stone celt “in
one mass on the old or former gravel-bed of the river, not far from
Toome Castle, on the county Antrim side.” At Toome were found
also the bronze weapons figured <a href="#plate37">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXVII.</span></a>, in which <a href="#plate37">No. 1</a> represents
a sword in a perfect state, having the point worked down
below the level of the blade, for about four inches; it has a broad
handle-plate, cleft for pommel, with six rivets still in position; it
is 25⅜ inches long and 1⅛ broad. <a href="#plate37">No. 2</a> is a complete blade, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the handle-plate is defective; it is brazed in two places, only half
an inch asunder, the line of junction being scarcely discernible; it
is bevel-edged, has hilt notches, four rivet-holes, and is 26½ inches
long, by 1¼ broad. <a href="#plate37">No. 3</a> is a plain blade, slightly corroded, and
wanting part of handle; its length is 19¼ inches, by 1¾ broad.
<a href="#plate37">No. 4</a>, <i>ibid.</i>, perfect, feather-edged, slight hilt notch, four rivet-holes
in handle-plate, 21 inches long, by 1⅜ broad. <a href="#plate37">No. 5</a> is a
leaf-shaped blade, 19 inches long and 1⅞ wide at broadest part:
this weapon is from the crannog of Bohermeen, county Meath, and
is here given for purpose of comparison. <a href="#plate37">No. 6</a> is a perfect knife-shaped
dagger, grooved in casting; slight raised notch on handle-plate,
and 4¾ inches in length. <a href="#plate37">No. 7</a> is a perfect specimen of the
long narrow spear-head; it has straight edges, loops at angle of
slender socket, broad bevelled edges, and is 16¼ inches long, by 2 in.
broad at base. <a href="#plate37">No. 8</a> is a thick, short, cast bronze spear-handle,
with bulbous extremities, 6¾ inches long, and it “still contains a
fragment of the ancient shaft.” This relic points to a close intercourse
between the north of Ireland and Scotland, for in their
wars against the Romans, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 208, the Caledonians had, amongst
other weapons of offence, a spear of peculiar construction, “having
a brazen knob at the end of the shaft, which they shook to terrify
their enemies.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p><i>Lough Mourne.</i>&mdash;The waters of this small lake, situated upon
a hill about 600 feet above the level of the sea, and three miles
due W. of Carrickfergus, were temporarily drained off in the summer
of 1882, to enable the engineers of the water-works to carry
on their operations; and, when the level of the lake had bee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>n
lowered ten feet, a number of artificial islands were exposed to
view. There was a <i>group</i> of crannogs consisting of four islets
erected on one common pile foundation, and at some little distance
there was a <i>solitary</i> crannog. The group was formed of some
hundreds of piles, four or five inches in diameter, with a cross
timbering of branches of various sizes upon a thick layer of heather
and moss. Upon this the four islets were built of boulder-stones
to form the floors of the wooden houses … the piles
generally retained their bark, and were mostly of pine, willow,
and ash, with occasionally some of oak; they were rudely pointed
on one side only. Many of the stones bore traces of fire, and had
evidently formed part of the hearth; a piled causeway, one hundred
yards long, led part of the way to the shore; the interior was
filled with heather and moss. The single crannog lay somewhat
farther from the shore, and in deeper water than the others;
greater skill, too, appears to have been displayed in its construction.
The lowest course (see section, <a href="#plate38">plate <span class="smcapuc">XXXVIII.</span></a>) was composed
of large stones, whose exact depth could not be ascertained owing
to a strong spring of water which flowed up between them; upon
this was a layer, two feet thick, of moss, which time and pressure
had converted into peat. Upon the moss were radiating timbers,
the outer ends of which rested on and were notched or mortised
into piles disposed in several rings round the island; these piles
and cross timbers were larger than in the composite crannog, and
many of them were of oak. Upon the timbers was a layer of
heather and brushwood, upon which rested the stones forming the
floor of the hut: in this case there was no causeway to the land.
The relics discovered were not numerous, but the soft, almost liquid
nature of the mud rendered a thorough search almost impossible.
There was found about five feet of the prow of a “dug out,” and,
in addition to charcoal and bones in considerable quantity, there
were two small stone crucibles, calcined flint flakes, several fossil
sea urchins from the chalk, worn smooth by having been carried
about as ornaments or charms; a small stone with a hole in it&mdash;possibly
also a charm&mdash;and a pair of “rubbing-stones.”<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> In midsummer,
1884, a very fine canoe of oak, found entire in the bed of
this lake, was presented to the Field Club by the Water Co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>mmissioners,
and has been by them lodged in the Belfast Museum.
This canoe appears to have been shaped chiefly by the axe; it is
hollowed out of a single trunk, is twelve feet eight inches in
length, and two feet six inches in width, the inside depth being
nine inches&mdash;the same breadth continues throughout&mdash;the bottom
of the canoe is perforated with six rather cleanly cut round holes,
about three quarters of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 198.&mdash;Dug-out Canoe found near the Crannog of Lough Mourne.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Lisnacroghera</i> crannog lies at a little distance from Broughshane,
in the parish of Skerry, barony of Antrim. About the
year 1882, workmen employed in cutting turf&mdash;bared by the
partial drainage of the lough&mdash;came upon oaken timbers laid in
regular order; unfortunately nearly all were removed before anyone
acquainted with the peculiarities of crannog structure had
seen them, and in the autumn of 1883, most of the timbers had
disappeared, though a few of the encircling piles remained in position.
Some remarkable antiquities, discovered either within or
around it, have been rescued from oblivion and destruction. A
spear with iron head and butt, and rivets of bronze, and the iron
sword-blades enclosed in sheaths of bronze (which are now in
Canon Grainger’s museum), seem to call for prominent notice.
With regard to these the Rev. James Graves says:&mdash;“It cannot be
denied that this crannog find is one of the most <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>important and
valuable yet recorded in Ireland, especially in its bearing on the
style and the chronology of the art of that early period when the
bronze and iron eras overlapped. The spears have bronze butts,
with terminal iron heads, for such were discovered in the crannog,
whilst no spear-heads of bronze&mdash;an imperishable metal&mdash;were
found. The bronze rivets remained in the shafts by which the
iron heads had been secured. All this reminded one of the ninth
century legend of the armourers of the Tuatha dé Danann when
preparing for battle with the Fomorians at the northern Moytura.
The mode of workmanship is graphically described:&mdash;Goibniu at
his forge finishes the spear-heads in three hammer-strokes (probably
they went through three processes in their fabrication); so it
was also with the work of Luchtiné on the ashen spear-shafts, and
Creidné on the bronze rivets. When Goibniu had finished the
iron lance-head, he seized it with his pincers and sent it quivering
into the door-post. Then Luchtiné launched the finished shaft so
surely aimed that it found the socket of the lance-head, and penetrating
to the bottom was firmly fixed there: whilst Creidné instantly
flung from his pincers the finished <i>bronze</i> rivet with so sure
and true an aim that it entered the rivet-holes to the required
depth, and so the weapon was completed (<i>Three Irish Glossaries</i>,
p. 32, <i>Sanas Cormaic</i>, p. 123). Hence, without assuming that the
bronze-iron age should be thrown back to the mythic period of the
Tuatha dé Danann and the Fomorians, it is evident that in the
ninth century there was a tradition of its characteristics and existence
in Ireland, and that of so remote a date as to suit the myth
of the contest of the gods of light and life with the deities of darkness
and death. The fashion of the spears, of the swords, and of
their sheaths, prevailing at this early period, when the use of
bronze and iron overlapped, has been hitherto but sparingly revealed
to us by finds of weapons in England, Scotland, and Scandinavia.
Kemble, in his <i>Horæ Ferales</i>, engraves several examples
of short swords or daggers, the fashion of which is identical with
that now for the first time so clearly shown us by the Lisnacroghera
crannog find.” Professor Anderson, in his <i>Rhind Lectures</i>, has
recorded the discovery of a bronze spear-butt, exactly similar, in
one of the <i>brochs</i> of Scotland; it is correlated by him with the
pagan iron age; and in a recent number of the <i>Proceedings</i> of the
Royal Society of Antiquaries of Denmark there is engraved an
iron sword-blade, with bronze haft-mountings, nearly identical in
form and fashion with those discovered at Lisnacroghera.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

found in the sand-hills of Ballintoy and the crannog of Lough-na-crannagh.”</p>

<p><i>Lough Ronel</i> is a name set down in the <span class="smcapuc">MS.</span> register of Irish
crannog objects, &amp;c., British Museum. It is most probably an
incorrect designation for Lough Ravel.</p>

<h4>COUNTY DOWN.</h4>

<p>During the working of the Commission for the Arterial Drainage
of Ireland, a crannog&mdash;no name given&mdash;was discovered in this
county, and traces of another at <i>Ardbrin</i> (<i>ante</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_126">126-8</a>).</p>

<p><i>Ballykinler.</i>&mdash;In 1860 this crannog was no longer traceable,
but fortunately a short description of it had been previously given.
The section made through its centre showed it to be of the usual
construction&mdash;surrounded by a circle of small piles, driven deep
into the mud, and secured by cross-beams firmly mortised togethe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>r,
the space so enclosed filled with brushwood, on which was placed a
layer of gravel and earth, that process being repeated until the
surface became perfectly solid.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p><i>Lough Faughan, or Falcon</i>, in the barony of Lecale.&mdash;About
the year 1845 a crannog was discovered in this lake. “There
were large stakes driven into the ground, completely enclosing the
space within, and not rising above the surface as a palisade, but
evidently for the purpose of keeping in the soil from encroachment
of the water. The tradition respecting it is, that there had been a
castle on the shore opposite, the chieftain of which caused this island
to be made as a place of refuge from the sudden onslaughts
of the O’Neils; and to render this retreat more secure he would
never allow more than one boat or canoe on the lake.” During
drainage operations a “dug-out” of oak was found near this crannog,
from which locality were also procured two earthen pitchers
(<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_92">92</a>, <a href="#fig066">fig. 66</a>).</p>

<p><i>Ballywoolen.</i>&mdash;This crannog was entire when seen in 1860, in a
lake surrounded by hills, the surface of the island nearly level
with the water. At one spot there was a flagging of flat stones
where the hearth had been, and near it lay a quern.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The discoverer
states the site of this crannog to be in the county Down;
but the only townland in Ireland named Ballywoolen, is set down
in the Ordnance Survey as situated in the parish of Dunboe,
barony of Coleraine, county Derry.</p>

<h4>COUNTY ARMAGH.</h4>

<p><i>Camlough</i> has a crannog at its north end.</p>

<p><i>Marlacoo Lough</i>, near Armagh, has another.</p>

<p><i>Lough Ross</i>, near Crossmaglen, also contains one, stated to
have been the place of meeting of the Irish leaders in 1641.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<h4>COUNTY TYRONE.</h4>

<p>During the working of the Commission for the Arterial Drainage
of Ireland, a crannog was discovered in this county, but its
exact locality was not defined.</p>

<p><i>Corcreevy</i> (alias <i>Loch-Laoghaire</i>), by which latter name it is
mentioned in the <i>Annals</i> (<i>ante</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_155">155-6</a>).&mdash;The site was examined
and the following articles brought to light: a pair of
bronze and iron manacles; a double comb of bone in a perfect
state, length 3 inches, and breadth 2⅜ inches, and having a brass
ring attached to one extremity&mdash;it is now in the Museum, R.I.A.;
parts of a musical instrument; an arrow-head; a spear-head; a
sling, or hammer-stone.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p><i>Cranny</i> townland in this county possibly derives its name
from having been the former site of a lake dwelling.</p>

<p><i>Clogherny</i>, in the parish of this name, in the barony of East
Omagh. The Rev. R. V. Dixon, D.D., thus notices the discovery
of a crannog situated in a bog on the borders of the townland of
Roscavey. About eight or ten feet below the surface turf-cutters
laid bare the tops of a row of oaken planks which described a
circle about seventy feet in diameter. These planks were from
eight inches to fourteen inches in width, and from three inches to
five inches in thickness, roughly split from the log, the lower extremities
pointed and driven ten or twelve inches into the ground;
their tops were all decayed; the length of the remaining part was
about four feet. Each plank was pierced by a square hole, bearing
marks of having been made by a blunt tool, and this orifice
was narrower at the centre than at the edges. The planks forming
the enclosure were placed edge to edge, and several rough logs of
alder and birch, from two inches to four inches in diameter, were
laid horizontally against the lower part of the planks on the ins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>ide
of the enclosure, which was floored with oak, and underneath was
about two feet of peat. Between the oaken floor and the outer
fence were several flag-stones, evidently the old hearths, as shown
by the quantity of charred wood that was about them. Southward
two square posts were found. This crannog lay in a depression
running nearly E. and W. between two sloping hills. “The
fall of this hollow is towards the east, where it spreads out and
sinks into a large basin, or glen, closed by rising ground of considerable
height to the north and east; by a gravel ridge, or ‘esker,’
on the south; and opening on the west into the hollow in which
the crannog stood. A considerable mountain stream enters this
basin from the east, and after flowing round a conical gravel hill
(connected with the esker) which stands in the middle of it, escapes
through a deep natural cut or gap in the esker which, as before
mentioned, closes the basin on the south. If this cut were closed,
the basin would be filled up by the stream which now flows through
it, and the level of the water would probably rise sufficiently high
to fill the hollow in which the crannog stood, and this hollow would
then form a shallow arm of the lake.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p><i>Fort Lough</i> occupies nearly the centre of an extensive bog on
the right-hand side of one of the roads leading from St. Johnstown
to Burt on Lough Swilly. It is described as about one mile long,
and a quarter wide, but was formerly of much greater extent.
There was a tradition that formerly a castle erected in the centre
of this lake had been submerged by the neglect of a girl in not
carefully <i>re</i>-covering a fairy fountain in the vaults, and consequently
the waters burst forth in a raging torrent! After drainage operations,
when the level of the lough subsided, marks of an island
became visible in the centre, and by degrees stonework was observed
rising above the surface, proving that the subaquatic castle
was not altogether mere visionary fiction. These walls were found
supporting a deposit of peat.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

BALLYDOOLOUGH CRANNOG, Co. FERMANAGH.</p>

<p class="caption">W.F. Wakeman, 1870.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Ballydoolough</i> (<i>the place of the dark lake</i>) is five miles distant
from the town of Enniskillen; the expanse of water covers not
more than twenty-four acres, and even during times of flood never
exceeds twenty feet in depth; at the bottom could be discerned
remains of a primæval forest. In June, 1870, from the effect
either of drainage or of long-continued drought, a small island
became apparent, on which were found fragments of fictile ware,
and this led to a careful examination being made. Near the
centre was an oaken beam, fifteen feet seven inches long, having
evidently formed portion of one side of the lower framework of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
dwelling. It was grooved throughout its entire length (<a href="#plate41">plate
<span class="smcapuc">XLI.</span>, No. 7</a>), and had two holes&mdash;measuring nine inches by six&mdash;that
were plainly intended for the reception of upright posts, to
which the sheeting or side-boards of the structure were attached.
Several oaken slabs, grooved at the sides (<a href="#plate41">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLI.</span>, No. 9</a>), were
discovered in close proximity buried in the sand and mud. Upon
clearing the foundation, the framework of the house was shown to
be composed of well-squared beams of oak, grooved for the reception
of planks, and mortised for the insertion of uprights, the
angles dovetailed together, and fastened with wooden pins. The
beam forming the eastern foundation of the house rested upon two
blocks of dressed oak that projected from it at a right-angle to a
distance of seven feet (<a href="#plate41">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLI.</span>, No. 2</a>), and this foundation
may perhaps have supported a landing-stage. The lowest timbers
of house and projecting beams were secured in position externally
and internally by a row of wooden pegs, or small stakes, which
enclosed the entire foundation, and rested against it on the exterior
(on the plan these are indicated by a dotted line); the south-western
angle of the house was strengthened by a flat block (<a href="#plate41">No. 6</a>).
Of the upper work of the edifice no description can be attempted,
though several dressed boards (<a href="#plate41">Nos. 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13</a>, on a scale of
⅛ inch to a foot), that had evidently formed part of the structure,
were found scattered about.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> On the western side of the island,
being the one most exposed to the action of the water, the stakes
were in greatest number, placed four, and at one point even five,
feet deep. In some instances their upper extremities had been
inserted in holes cut for their reception in beams of oak laid horizontally,
and although only one such beam was found still <i>in situ</i>,
yet an inhabitant of the locality stated that within his memory
many of the horizontal timbers could be seen actually resting upon
the stakes or piles, just below the surface of the water. The
kitchen-midden of the dwelling contained a considerable quantity
of bones, intermixed with numerous fragments of pottery. A selection
of the bones having been forwarded to Professor Richard
Owen for analysis, he pronounced them to be parts of <i>Bos longifrons</i>,
<i>Cervus elephas</i>, <i>Sus scrofa</i>, and <i>Equus asinus</i>. In a more or less
restored form, characteristic specimens of the pottery are figured
(<i>ante</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_92">92</a>, <a href="#Page_95">95</a>, <a href="#Page_96">96</a>, <a href="#Page_97">97</a>). There were not many articles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> bronze,
but mention may be made of a plate of that metal, oblong in form,
about as thick as a sixpenny-piece, and measuring five and a-half
inches in length, by four and a-half inches in breadth; it retained
a number of rivets, and appeared like a patch off some pan or dish.
In Ireland the majority of cauldrons or dishes composed of thin
golden bronze are usually found to have been carefully mended.
Of wood, a vessel was discovered in an entire state, but from long
saturation reduced almost to a pulp (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_102">102</a>, <a href="#fig103">fig. 103</a>); and
there was a small oaken vessel formed with staves. There were also
balls of stone, varying in size from that of an orange to a walnut;
several querns, and the inscribed stone described and figured (<i>ante</i>,
p. <a href="#Page_134">134</a>).<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p><i>Coolyermer</i> is the name of a lake four miles from Enniskillen,
in the direction of Letterbreen; it contains an island which seemed
to be composed entirely of oaken beams; the water, however, was
too high to admit of an examination being made.</p>

<p><i>Drumdarragh</i>, otherwise <i>Trillick</i>, has been recently thoroughly
examined by W. F. Wakeman, whose report, accompanied by numerous
drawings of remains discovered within the crannog, is prepared
for publication in the <i>Journal of the Royal Hist. and Arch.
Association of Ireland</i>. To the Museum of that Society the Earl
of Enniskillen, in 1875, presented an oak paddle found at Drumdarragh
crannog, in company with a single-tree canoe that had
been unfortunately destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

</div>

<p><i>Drumgay</i> (<i>the ridge of the geese</i>) lies nearly four miles to the
north of the town of Enniskillen, and separated from the northern
shore of Lough Erne by a narrow belt of land. This sheet of
water is completely land-locked; there are in it three islets, and
the south-eastern shore has a projecting point of artificial construction
that becomes an island owing to the rise of water in winter
time. <a href="#plate42">Plate <span class="smcapuc">XLII.</span>, No. 1</a>, conveys an excellent idea of the general
aspect of the lake, and of the position of the islands; the large
wooded one, situated near the centre, and now known as “Bone
Island”&mdash;although its older appellation appears to have been
“Cherry Island”&mdash;is constructed of beams of oak, ash, and pine,
laid in rough blocks, radiating from a centre to the edge of a circle
formed of stakes set in the ground, the diameter from north to
south being one hundred and five feet, but from east to west a few
feet less (<a href="#plate42">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLII.</span>, No. 2</a>). When the lake is at summer level
the encircling piles are plainly visible; they had been roughly
trimmed with an instrument of metal; the longitudinal cuts measured
nearly a foot, and some of the piles were of oak (<a href="#plate42">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLII.</span>,
No. 7</a>); they had no slope outward, and only at a few points did
the rough wood and small branches usually interwoven with them
still remain in position. From a point near the centre of the
crannog, in a direct line to the eastern shore, a trench was dug; it
commenced in the centre, was cut outwards to the water’s edge,
and thus prevented sudden flooding; a similar trench was subsequently
made on the opposite shore. As the result of these excavations,
a very distinct idea of the internal construction of the work
was obtained (<a href="#plate42">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLII.</span>, No. 4</a>). The old crannog-builders appear
to have selected a natural shoal in the lough as the scene of
their operations. This shoal consisted of marl covered by a streak
of whitish sand about four inches in depth; over the sand, to a
height of six or eight inches, was a stratum of yellowish clay,
which supported unhewn logs of oak and birch, together with an
immense quantity of small branches, twigs, brambles, and small
pebbles, all compressed into a peat-like mass about two feet thick;
this was covered by two feet of earth, containing here and there
layers of burnt clay and bones; the clay was mixed throughout
with bones of animals greatly broken, articles of early manufacture,
slag or dross iron, charcoal, and rough stones. The surface
of the island was in many parts covered with flat stones of considerable
size, and stakes larger than those which formed the outer
circle, yet of the same character, were found here and th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>ere, even
in the highest and most central parts; they were designed to stay
and prop the work, for their points were deeply imbedded in the
marl which formed the bottom of the lough. It was impossible
to procure any perfect specimen of these supports, as the wood,
softened by saturation, broke off on application of the slightest
pressure. Scattered amongst the bones that lay upon the shore of
the island, were several fragments of earthen vessels; the one
represented (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>) was found here. Although search was
made, yet comparatively few antiques were brought to light.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>In <a href="#plate42">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLII.</span></a> a large island is represented to the extreme left;
this is what may be termed a composite crannog. The body of
the island, formed entirely of stones, was formerly surrounded by
rows of oaken stakes; none, however, are now to be seen; they
served as fuel to a man who lived on the shores of the lake. The
greatest height of this island above summer level of the water was
about five feet, the form an irregular oval, two hundred and seventy
feet in length, by one hundred and thirty-eight feet in breadth,
and a trench cut through to a depth of five feet reached what
seemed to have been the ancient bottom of the lake. The great
peculiarity of this structure is that the collection of small flat sandstones
of which it was composed had been placed on edge (<a href="#plate42">plate
<span class="smcapuc">XLII.</span>, No. 5</a>). By the country people it is appropriately styled
“the quarry.” Close to the north-western extremity of the lake
may be seen a small crannog&mdash;about thirty feet in diameter&mdash;that
is all but submerged even in the dryest season; the few oaken
timbers that remain seem to radiate from a common centre, and
are intermixed with stones, as shown in <a href="#plate42">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLII.</span>, No. 3</a>. Evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
this islet had originally been strongly staked. The fourth
and last crannog is represented at the extreme right of the general
view of the lake; but here the crannog wrecker had been at work,
and the stakes that formerly entirely surrounded it were pulled up
and used as fuel. A curiously sculptured stone (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_90">90</a>) was
discovered here. The last two crannogs lay at a very low level,
owing perhaps to the fact of an unusual quantity of boughs and
compressible matter having been used in their construction. Portion
of a single-tree canoe of oak was found in the lake, as also
two very neatly formed paddles of oak, measuring about two and
a-half feet in length.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p><i>Gortalough (the field of the lake)</i> is situated near Drumgay, and
within three miles of Enniskillen. Here a log-house, or crannog-hut
was discovered buried under many feet of peat, but no trace of
it now remains.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p><i>Drumskimly</i>, near Derrygonnelly.&mdash;In this lake, now almost
drained, there were formerly two crannogs that are in the present
day dry and under cultivation; but there remained a little island
surrounded by water and well palisaded in the usual manner; it
was circular in form, and about thirty-five feet in diameter; its
surface has been converted into a garden. From time to time
were here disinterred a spear-head and arrow-head, both of iron;
a pair of quern-stones, and many fragments of pottery; one of the
latter is figured (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_100">100</a>).<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p><i>Drumsloe.</i>&mdash;See <i>ante</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_87">87-88</a>.</p>

<p><i>Ballaghmore</i> is the name now applied to a lake (about a mile
and a-half from Enniskillen) in which was a crannog seemingly
composed entirely of earth and stones, in a soft depth of mud,
surrounded with a mass of aqueous vegetation. No piles were
visible.</p>

<p><i>Moinenoe (the bog of the yew)</i> is a locality about a mile from
Enniskillen, and sometimes called Chanter Hill. It was the former
site of a lake which now in summer becomes a soft and treacherous
swamp, and such traces of the crannog as yet remain would be difficult
to explore. A single-tree canoe was found in the bed of the
ancient lough.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Breagho (wolf-field).</i>&mdash;Near a place of this name labourers when
cutting turf came upon a stockaded enclosure buried some twelve
or fourteen feet below the then surface of the bog; the crannog
was circular, and about thirty-five feet in diameter. A pair of
quern-stones, a large oaken, bowl-shaped vessel, split in several
places, and the sawn and perforated bones of a <i>Megaceros hibernicus</i>,
were the only “finds” recorded.</p>

<p><i>Aughlish.</i>&mdash;In a lake so called, about five miles from Enniskillen,
in the direction of Boho, there is a crannog, but the height
of the water precluded an examination. The tops of numerous
piles are frequently visible in summer-time.</p>

<p><i>Killynure (the wood of the yews)</i> is a small lakelet, distant a
mile from Enniskillen, on the Tempo road. It contains a crannog
which is usually flooded.</p>

<p><i>Lough Acrussel</i> is situated near Enniskillen. The crannog
was found standing in deep water; but after a continuance of dry
weather the piling all around could be distinctly seen, and the
posts were, as a rule, connected by horizontal beams. Near the
centre of the island there was a large flag-stone that had evidently
been used as a hearth. Upon sinking shallow trenches through
portions of the work, bones and teeth of animals of the usual character
were discovered, as also iron slag, wood charcoal in small
quantities, and some thin pieces of bronze, seemingly parts of a
cauldron or dish. The plan of the crannog was nearly a perfect
circle, and its diameter sixty feet.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p><i>Lough Yoan.</i>&mdash;In the summer of 1883, the crannog in this lake
was visited by W. F. Wakeman, who reported that its surface
seemed covered with bones of various animals, the larger of them
having been broken apparently for extraction of the marrow.
There were several whetstones and fragments of querns; but no
traces of woodwork remained visible, though possibly by digging
through the sand and stones, of which the shoal is chiefly composed,
some discoveries might be made.</p>

<p><i>Lankhill.</i>&mdash;In this lake, situated near Enniskillen, a crannog
was discovered by W. F. Wakeman, by whom it will be described
in a forthcoming number of the <i>Journal Royal Hist. and Arc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>h.
Association of Ireland</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lough Macnean</i> contains four islets, the one lying close to the
western shore being appropriately designated “Crannog Island.”
Its diameter is about sixty-four feet, and the work, which consists
of a cairn of stones&mdash;rising to a height of eight or ten feet above
the winter level of the water&mdash;had been formerly enclosed by a
double row of piles composed of oak, yew, and pine. The usual
amount of bones, a couple of fragments of pottery, and a large
quantity of iron slag and charcoal, alone were discovered, although
the shore was carefully searched. The island situated near Belcoo
was of the same dimensions and formation; nothing but bones,
slag, and charcoal, were found in it. In the crannog at the
southern extremity of the lake, digging had to be discontinued in
consequence of the percolation of the water. Much of the piling
was still visible, although everywhere reduced to a state of pulp.
The fourth islet, named <i>Inishee</i> (i. e. <i>fairy island</i>), yielded nothing;
it was of natural formation.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p><i>Lenaghan.</i>&mdash;Here, about three miles from Enniskillen, is a
small lake containing a crannog. On it were found immense
numbers of animal bones, as also some few antiquities; one of

<p><i>Lough Eyes</i> is situated two miles north-east of the village of
Lisbellaw; it is about two-thirds of a mile long, by less than a
quarter of a mile across at its greatest breadth. This lough was
not known to possess any manner of interest, scenic or otherwise,
except indeed for the disciples of Isaak Walton, who found it well
stocked with scaly prey. The Irish name of the lake appears to
have been lost, possibly corrupted, or perhaps translated, for near
the southern shore a spring called <i>Tobernasoul</i>&mdash;“<i>the well of the
eyes</i>”&mdash;still gives forth water forming a small rivulet that connects
the well with the lake, so that in all probability this furnishes a
clue to the modern name of the sheet of water. Lough Eyes, like
the crannog retreats of Ballydoolough and Drumgay&mdash;distant respectively
about three miles&mdash;was anciently embosomed in a dense
primæval forest. The roots and portions of the stems of oak, pine,
and alder, of immense size, remained <i>in situ</i>, and were in such close
proximity that their foliage must have commingled and formed a
canopy impervious to storm. The forest, however, has been “par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>ed
to the stump,” as may be seen from the sketch of the locality&mdash;taken
from the south-east&mdash;which conveys a fair idea of the <i>tout
ensemble</i> of the scene. In consequence of the exceptional dryness
of the summer of 1870, the level of the water was greatly diminished,
and the islands (six in number) became exposed to view
(<a href="#plate43">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIII.</span>, No. 1</a>). Although the elevation of the remains
above the surface of the water was unequal, still the rows of piling
by which the lake dwellings had been protected and enclosed were
on about the same plane. The crannog that was situated in the
deepest part of the lake would appear to have sunk, but its subsidence
may be attributed to the perishable nature of its component
parts&mdash;logs and branches. The other habitations were constructed
upon shoals&mdash;in one instance upon a natural turf-bank artificially
strengthened, and then raised to the required height with layers of
sticks, brambles, earth, and stones. <a href="#plate43">Plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIII.</span>, Nos. 2, 3, 4</a>,
give the ground-plan, section, and general aspect of the most important
crannog of the group; its greatest height above summer
level is ten feet, but it is never entirely submerged; it measures
two hundred and eight feet in circumference. A trench cut across
the island (<a href="#plate43">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIII.</span>, No. 3</a>) demonstrated its artificial strata
to be as follows:&mdash;The surface consisted of a layer&mdash;averaging a
foot in depth&mdash;of stones deposited without any appearance of regularity;
these stones rested upon a layer of earth (<a href="#plate43">A</a>) of similar
thickness, from which broken bones and small particles of charcoal
were disinterred. Underneath was a stratum (<a href="#plate43">B</a>) that had been
formed of branches of oak, alder, pine, hazel, &amp;c., roughly thrown
together, and with traces of the bark still distinctly discernible,
intermixed also with remains of brambles, decayed foliage, small
stones or gravel, a little earth and bog mould. Next followed
about six feet of a seemingly undisturbed stratum of peat (<a href="#plate43">C</a>), lying
upon a deposit of sand and marl (<a href="#plate43">D and E</a>), which probably at
some very remote period had formed the original lake bottom.
The stockading that originally surrounded the islet still existed.
To the west and north the stakes were four deep, driven in close
together, and forming an almost solid whole; they were nearly all
of oak, roughly hewn, and sharply pointed by a metal instrument
(<a href="#plate43">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIII.</span>, No. 5</a>). Half buried in the soil were several pieces
of oak&mdash;one a barrel-shaped block (<a href="#plate43">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIII.</span>, No. 8</a>), one foot
four inches in length, by one foot ten inches in circumference;
the groove cut in one of its sides is two inches deep, by one a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>nd
a-half inches broad. The other block (<a href="#plate43">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIII.</span>, No. 6</a>) measures
one foot seven inches, by six inches; another is slightly
smaller; and a fourth (<a href="#plate43">No. 9</a>) has all the appearance of having
formed portion of the bottom of a wooden vessel; it measures
twelve inches across.</p>

<p>Subsequently, at a season when the water was exceptionally
low, the locality was again examined, and a shoal or ridge, evidently
the remains of a piled causeway by which the islands in
Lough Eyes had been connected together, was then discovered.
In the neighbourhood a tradition existed that in ancient times “a
road passed through Lough Eyes.” This lingering belief would
be fully explained by the existence of a <i>kesh</i> or causeway&mdash;and
upon this, as well as upon the main crannog, was found a quantity
of bones of the <i>Bos longifrons</i>, red deer, ass, sheep, goat, and pig.
Mixed with the animal remains was an extraordinary collection of
broken earthen vessels like those in the Drumgay and Ballydoolough
sites. The fragments were nearly all more or less ornamented
with indented patterns, sometimes arranged simply in
lines, in other cases presenting chevron designs. The illustrations
(<i>ante</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>, <a href="#Page_94">94</a>) represent two of these vessels restored. <a href="#fig071">Fig. 71</a> is
a flat disc, seemingly a cover or lid. Figs. <a href="#fig072">72</a>, <a href="#fig073">73</a>, <a href="#fig098">98</a>, <a href="#fig099">99</a>, and <a href="#fig100">100</a>,
were also found in this locality. Second in position from the left
side of the general view of Lough Eyes (<a href="#plate43">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIII.</span></a>), a very
small island (No. 2 crannog) may be discerned in the distance:
this is a sunken crannog; its appearance is shown in the lowest
sketch (<a href="#plate44">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIV.</span></a>). To the right, in the general view (<a href="#plate43">plate
<span class="smcapuc">XLIII.</span></a>), is the most northern crannog (No. 3) of the group; its
general plan and details form the three upper sketches of
<a href="#plate44">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIV.</span></a> The shape was circular, the diameter about
fifty feet, the piles stood almost as originally driven, but the
horizontal timbers of the interior had disappeared. A cruciform
section demonstrated that the island consisted of a low mound
formed of sand, earth, and stones, which had settled down into
their then position. A whetstone, and portion of a highly decorated
quern (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_88">88</a>), rewarded the search. Bones lay
scattered along the beach, as well as over the surface of the islet,
and pottery was found in abundance (see <i>ante</i>, <a href="#plate18">plate <span class="smcapuc">XVIII.</span></a>).
The fourth island (No. 4) from the left of the view is represented
in the sketch second from the bottom (<a href="#plate44">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIV.</span></a>). It was
similar to the last described: a cruciform section of considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
depth threw little light on the internal construction; there were
only layers of earth, sand, and sticks. The result of a search and
digging along the shore brought to light a portion of the upper
stone of a quern, fractured bones, and small fragments of pottery.
The fifth crannog was of the sunken class, although some of the
stakes were still <i>in situ</i>. It was low and narrow, seldom above
water, therefore its exploration was practically impossible. Some
bones and fragments of pottery (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#plate19">plate <span class="smcapuc">XIX.</span></a>), a whetstone,
and pieces of a jet bracelet, were the sole mementoes discovered.
The sixth, and last crannog is to the extreme right of the general
view (<a href="#plate43">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIII.</span></a>). In summer-time, during low water, it was
a peninsula. Many of the stakes retained their position, but a
section made into it presented nothing of importance. From
about the group of crannogs, fragmentary specimens of what had
probably been bracelets of jet were discovered, and the axe-head
of deer’s horn figured and described (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_59">59</a>) was dug up in
this locality. The bones, pottery, and other debris, seemed to be
distributed pretty equally all around. Copper vessels had been
found in connexion with these lake dwellings, but attracted no
attention as they were supposed to be part of the “plant” of
poteen distillers.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> In the neighbourhood small mounds&mdash;consisting
chiefly of heaps of burnt sandstone&mdash;were very common; these
stones were easily pulverised.</p>

<p><i>Wolf Loch.</i>&mdash;There is said to have been formerly a crannog in
this lake.</p>

<p><i>Loughavilly (the lake of the old tree)</i>, now nearly drained, is
represented (<a href="#plate45">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLV.</span></a>) as seen from the south, with Topped
Mountain in the background. The piled mound visible in the
middle distance, to the right, is the remains of a crannog that appeared
to belong to an age when stone implements were in use,
judging from the character of the few antiquities found within it.
In the summer of 1871 there was still observable a small portion
of the original lake dwelling. “This consisted of a roughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
squared block of oak, measuring four feet three inches in length,
by one foot in breadth. It was nine inches in thickness, and exhibited
upon what appeared to have been its upper surface two
quadrangular mortise-holes, one of which was a square, six inches
by six inches, and four inches in depth; the other, an oblong, six
inches by five inches, and somewhat shallower than the former.
They were placed at a distance of one foot three inches apart, and
presented all the appearance of having been fashioned by a rude
stone instrument.” The mortise-holes were not deeply sunk in
the two logs remaining on this crannog; they are represented
(<a href="#plate46">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLVI.</span>, figs. 14 and 15</a>). <a href="#plate46">Fig. 16</a>, a rudely-shaped stone
axe-head or chisel, four and a-half inches in length by two and
a-half inches in extreme breadth, was also discovered here.</p>

<p><i>Kilnamaddo.</i>&mdash;For description of this crannog, see <i>ante</i>, pp.
<a href="#Page_37">37-39</a>. Amongst the “finds” were an ordinary whetstone, a
couple of hammer-stones, some flint-flakes, a large tray-like vessel
composed of oak, some fragments of rude pottery, and a pair of
rubbing-stones. <a href="#plate46">Plate <span class="smcapuc">XLVI.</span>, figs. 5 and 9</a>, are angle-posts of
the second hut, they measure respectively three feet eleven inches,
and four feet nine inches. <a href="#plate46">Figs. 6, 7, and 8</a> (about one foot four

cleanly cut by a sharp metallic instrument.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The Miracles.</i>&mdash;At a place bearing this singular name, and
situated near the village of Monea, turf-cutters in the year 1875
came upon the remains of a hut occupying the centre of an artificial
island which stood in the middle of what had formerly been
a small lake. Unfortunately the timbers and beams with which
it was constructed were carried off before anyone skilled in archæological
matters had seen them <i>in situ</i>; but the posts represented
(<a href="#plate46">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLVI.</span>, figs. 11, 12, and 13</a>) were evidently angle-posts, resembling
those in Kilnamaddo, and, like them, not exhibiting the
bruised appearance produced by stone hatchets. There were pieces
of iron slag, quantities of burnt wood, a well-formed crucible,
sharpening and grinding stones, a stone or pounding instrument
(<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_74">74</a>), and a beautifully-formed, highly-polished, axe-head,
and a chisel of stone. Amongst the “finds” were numerous
articles of bronze, which are now dispersed, and cannot be traced;
but from the description given of them by the workmen they were
probably fibulæ. There were also several oaken paddles, of whic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>h
one is now in the Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A.; the dimensions of another
were seven and a-quarter inches in length, the breadth of the blade
being three inches; the handle terminated in an oval expansion
measuring two and a-half inches across. Single-piece canoes have,
from time to time, been discovered in the neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p><i>Rossole Lake.</i>&mdash;In the neighbourhood of this sheet of water
(<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>) there lingers a tradition of a “buried city” lying in
its depths; therefore, in the event of drainage, it is more than
probable a crannog site might be disclosed to view.</p>

<h4>COUNTY MONAGHAN.</h4>

<p>During the working of the Commission for the Arterial Drainage
of Ireland, six crannogs were disclosed in this county; four of
these sites have not been identified.</p>

<p><i>Lough Fea.</i>&mdash;A stockaded island in this lake (discovered in
1843) is described in Shirley’s <i>Dominion of Farney</i>.</p>

<p><i>Aghnamullen.</i>&mdash;<i>Ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_135">135</a>.</p>

<p><i>Lough Ooney.</i>&mdash;<i>Ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>.</p>

<p><i>Ballyhoe</i> Lake, distant about five miles from Carrickmacross,
was described by G. Morant as situated on the southern verge of
the county Monaghan, the greater part of it being in Meath. The
lake, of horse-shoe form, is of tolerable extent; the river Glyde,
or Lagan, runs through it, and by this stream it is connected with
several lakelets lying more northward in the county Monaghan;
at the toe of the horse-shoe, owing to the large deposit of mud
brought down by the river, the water is very shallow. In this
lake were two artificial islands, one of great extent, the other much
smaller. In the larger island, to which a causeway led from the
mainland, were numerous mounds which had been partially excavated,
and here were found two fine specimens of bronze pins,
other articles of lesser interest in lead and iron; also a flint spear-head.
The shores of the lake were for the most part boggy and
full of large timber, stumps and stems appearing in gre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>at quantities,
both above and below the level of the water, which was reduced
several feet by the drainage of the river. The centre of the
horse-shoe was occupied by a peninsula of bog-land with a coating
of grass: this tract also abounded with timber, the stumps in many
places projecting above the soil. In August, 1864, on the east
shore of this peninsula, were observed two chert spear-heads lying
just beneath the water at its lowest summer level, and a few yards
further along the beach was a rude stone hatchet, about six inches
long and two inches deep in its broadest part. The following
spring, when the winter floods had subsided, measures were taken
to search very carefully, and the result was the collection of a great
many flint implements of various types, the greater number of
which were lying only a few inches below the surface of the soil,
and generally ashes were found with them. In one place a dark-coloured
glass bead of barrel-shape was with the flint-flakes, and
close to the stump of a large tree was a very fine polished stone
hatchet with squared sides, the edge sharp and quite uninjured.
In one of the holes made in the bog by the feet of cattle lay a
beautiful little arrow-head of dark flint, triangular in shape,
chipped to an exquisite sharpness, and curved inwards at the base
to form the barbs. With the flakes, knives, scrapers, arrow and
spear-heads of flint, were also many specimens in chert or Lydian
stone. Near the exit of the river from the lake two different types
of light-coloured flint arrow-heads were discovered, the one barbed,
and about one and three-quarter inches, the other two inches in
length, and of peculiar form; the latter lay where a deep cutting
had been made during the drainage works, and near this spot was
anciently a ford, the scene of several encounters between the Danes
and Irish, and where in later times the forces of Elizabeth, and the
Irish under Tyrone, met in battle array. In a field on the Meath
side of the river, stood a castle of which no vestige now remains
above the ground: the foundation may, however, still be traced,
and many articles have, from time to time, been ploughed and
dug up about the site of this old fortalice of the Pale. A fine
silver coin of Mary, and a good specimen of a pin-brooch in bronze,
with red enamel setting, were found there.</p>

<p>The larger crannog, separated from the mainland by a shallow
channel, was in summer accessible by a narrow causeway. In one
of its mounds&mdash;principally composed of ashes&mdash;were leaden bullets,
sharpening-stones, and implements of iron; on its shores a flint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
spear-head and bronze pins; on the edges of the lake close by, flint
arrow-heads, hatchets, &amp;c., all of which, found at about the same
level, were certainly submerged until the drainage works permanently
reduced the height of the lake by several feet. Bullets
discovered in these crannogs prove that they were occupied up to a
comparatively late date.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

of iron instruments (use unknown); a long gun-barrel, or caliver;
part of the lock of a pistol, and many bullets of lead.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p><i>Monalty</i> (near Lisanisk).&mdash;The first mention of the discovery
of various ancient relics in a small artificial island in this lake was
made by Mr. Shirley. There was a canoe (hollowed out of a single
piece of oak), measuring twenty-four feet in length, also stone and
bronze celts, spear-heads, needles, pins, &amp;c., from all which it would
seem that here had been one of the strongholds of the chiefs of the
district. This crannog&mdash;afterwards explored by G. Morant&mdash;is
situated close to the shore, and during the low state of the water
in the year 1863, it became accessible by wading over a few yards
of mud. When searching on the exposed side of the island a
jewelled ornament was perceived, slightly projecting above the
gravel, stones, and mud of which the beach was composed. This
proved to be a rock crystal, oval in shape, and set transparently;
the crystal, with its silver setting, measured two and a-half inches
in length, by one and three-quarter inches across, and was much
corroded on the front; the little points were surrounded with
a cable-twist, as was also the setting. It was pronounced by a
competent authority to be a work of the fourteenth or fifteent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>h
century. Lying on the surface of the boggy soil was another
antique, considered to be a harp-pin; it was of highly-finished
work in bronze, the barrel having within it indications of rust.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
The crannog had been searched long previously by a man who
made a trade of selling antiquities, so that the good fortune of
discovering these curiosities must be attributed to the fact of the
water-level having been so exceptionally low in the year 1863.</p>

<p><i>Rahan’s Lake</i> is situated near Carrickmacross, and here in 1863
the hearth of a crannog was uncovered; on it were found a quantity
of ashes, together with five Queen Mary shillings, fused into
a mass, probably by the conflagration which had consumed the
dwelling. A bronze pin, a flat spear-head, and stone celt, were
also brought to light.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p><i>Leesborough Lake.</i>&mdash;An iron skean, seventeen inches long including
the tang, the blade thirteen inches, one and a-quarter inches
wide at the handle, and one-quarter inch thick, tapering to the
point, was found here.</p>

<p><i>Kilmore Lake.</i>&mdash;Two crannogs are known to have existed in
this sheet of water.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<h4>COUNTY CAVAN.</h4>

<p><i>Cloneygonnell</i> (otherwise Tonymore)&mdash;a townland in the
parish of Kilmore, barony of Lower Loughtee&mdash;contained three
crannogs that became exposed when the waters of Tonymore
Lough had been run off by arterial drainage. Although the tops
of the outer row of piles could be seen projecting above the surface,
yet the real nature of the largest of these islands&mdash;a green
oblong mound&mdash;was not suspected until after the railway had
passed through a portion of it. The land was described as rising,
in a succession of low hills, from what had been the ancient margin
of the lake; on the north and south sides were the raths of
Shancloon and Cloneygonnell, as shown (<a href="#plate47">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLVII.</span></a>, <a href="#fig202">fig. 202</a>),
and there were several raths of minor importance. In 1862, Dr.
Malcomson of Cavan, carefully examined the locality, and made
a sketch of the general appearance of the ancient lake bed and
neighbourhood (<a href="#fig203">fig. 203</a>), as well as a representation of the section
of the larger crannog where cut by the railway (<a href="#fig204">fig. 204</a>). The
piles or stakes were arranged in two circles, one within the other,
the diameter of the greater one being one hundred and twenty
feet, and that of the other ninety feet. The piles in the outer
circle were very numerous, and in some instances driven in close
proximity to each other; a few appeared about three feet above
the surface, and upon being withdrawn and examined were found
to have been carefully pointed. The stakes in the inner row were
not so numerous; some of them were of oak, others being of sallow
or other soft wood. Within the stockade were observed two
small mounds, one at the north, the other at the south. Corresponding
with the depression between these, and three feet under
the soil, was discovered during the excavation a flat stone four
feet square and three inches thick, resting on a number of upright
blocks of oak; this, no doubt, was a hearthstone. The most elevated
point of the mound, towards the south of the island, had a
crater-like appearance. Besides the wooden stakes which entered
into the formation of the circles, others appear to have been laid
horizontally, their beam-like ends showing at that part of the enclosure
which was disturbed by the passage of the railway. On
exploring the crannog, and when the excavations had b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>een carried

<p>The superficial soil was gradually removed in order to expose
the original flooring and examine its peculiar arrangement. During
the removal of this stratum the workmen turned up a few antique
specimens, amongst them portion of a glazed crucible, and a large
mass of brownish metallic dross, quite convex on one surface. The
principal stretchers&mdash;about forty in number&mdash;which composed the
flooring were of black oak, in a tolerable state of preservation;
each plank was from six to twelve feet in length, and from six to
twelve inches square. They were laid down so as to extend lengthways
from the circumference towards the centre, forming a number
of radiæ somewhat like the spokes of a wheel; their outer ends
were kept in position by slender crooked trunks of oak-trees forming
a kind of circle, these again being fixed into their places by
the outer row of stockades. The planks were not in close apposition,
and the spaces so left were filled with thick branches of
sallow, deal, and hazel, with the bark on; many of the branches
extended underneath the sleepers, thus separating them from the
peat bottom. The branches were for the most part rotten, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
easily broken down. Hazel nuts were found here hard and brown,
as if but just fallen from the tree. When the peat was removed
to a depth of two feet near the outer part of the enclosure, the
space so left was immediately filled up with bog water. A similar
examination made near the centre exposed a hard foundation of
blue clay. The timbers composing the crannog appeared to have
been roughly hewn, and were not joined together by nails or mortises;
two of the stretchers, however, had mortises. This site was
most thoroughly examined. In the same marsh, but nearer to the
ruin of Tonymore Castle, there were traces of two other stockaded
dwellings (<a href="#plate47">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLVII.</span></a>, <a href="#fig202">fig. 202</a>), an elevated causeway leading
from them to what had been formerly the mainland.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

</div>

<p><i>Drumkeery Lough</i> is situated two and a-half miles north of Bailieborough.
In 1863 the level of this lake having been lowered,
the fact became apparent that it had been, in olden times, the abode
of a lacustrine population. <a href="#plate48">Plate <span class="smcapuc">XLVIII.</span></a>, <a href="#fig206">fig. 206</a>, shows the former
extent and shape of the lake. Near its southern margin there
was an oval-shaped island, converted into a peninsula by the change
in the water-level. The aspect of the locality is described, and also
represented in an outline sketch, by Professor Harkness, the original
island being shown (<a href="#plate48">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLVIII.</span></a>, <a href="#fig207">fig. 207</a>) by the portion marked
<a href="#plate48">A</a>, including the area <a href="#plate48">B</a>, while the present peninsula is indicated
by the letters <a href="#plate48">CCC</a>. The crannog was situated on the peninsula,
and the approach to it had been from the south, as indicated by
remains of a stockade of birch piles, <a href="#plate48">DD</a>, extending from both sides
of the entrance, whilst at the eastern corner of the latter was a
large oak pile with a four-sided hole cut through it. Large vertical
oak slabs, with interspaces of three feet between each pile, formed
the sides of the entrance <a href="#plate48">EE</a>, the interspaces filled in with smaller
slabs of oak inclined outwards; the strong vertical piles had been
well secured; on examination it was found that about nine feet of
their length lay below the then surface. The floor of the entrance <a href="#plate48">F</a>
was formed of large flat stones, and underlying this rude pavement
were pieces of cleft oak. The area occupied by the crannog was an
Irish acre&mdash;the longer axis being nearly north and south&mdash;and it
was enclosed by piling composed principally of birch, retaining the
bark. These birch poles, on the end inserted into the ground, had
usually a wedge-shaped outline; some of the smaller trees seem to
have been cut down by a single blow, and driven into the ground
without further sharpening. Piles of oak which also occurred in
the crannog were much better pointed, tapering regularly in some
cases from their extremity for four feet upwards. Round oak piles
were found in several parts of the stockade; whilst cleft oak was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
observed only at the entrance in one or two parts of the stockade,
and in single piles here and there in the crannog. It has been
computed that the number of piles used in forming and strengthening
the construction must have exceeded 30,000. The stockade
was composed of piles placed in close contiguity, without interspaces;
and in the interior, near the piling, there was a layer of
gravelly clay and large stones, varying from two inches to two feet
in thickness, its object being to give a uniform level; and this comparatively
narrow space was the only artificially elevated portion
of surface in the crannog, which differed from most others previously
met with in Ireland, in apparently not having required to
be raised above the water; but there is evidence of the level having
risen five and a-half feet since the period of its occupation. At the
northern extremity of what had been the crannog was a space
about a rood and a-half in size, <a href="#plate48">B</a>, occupied by fragments of burnt
bones and charcoal&mdash;the kitchen midden of the place. This deposit,
nine inches in thickness, rested upon the natural surface of the
island, of which the entire area <a href="#plate48">AB</a> was flat, and before the lake
was lowered stood two and a-half feet above the ordinary level.
On the north side the supports for a landing-stage, <a href="#plate48">H</a>, were composed
of two rows of piles that ran obliquely <i>outwards</i> from the
girdle of piling <a href="#plate48">G</a>; and on the east side was another series of double
piling, <a href="#plate48">I</a>, the piles about three and a-half feet apart, and they
differed from the formation on the N.W. in extending <i>inwards</i> from
the main stockade. Opposite to this, and firmly embedded in the
oozy bottom of the lake, was seen a single-piece canoe, <a href="#plate48">J</a>, formed
out of an oak trunk; the double row of piling extending inwards
doubtless enclosed a “dock” destined to receive and secure the
canoe when not in use.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>
<p>On the north side of the lough, nearly opposite this crannog,
there were traces of another of smaller size. Birch and round piles
of oak were distinctly recognizable; these occurred also at various
intervals along the margin of the water, indicating the former
existence of several lake dwellings. Along the shore have been
discovered traces of many ancient fireplaces<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> more than six inches
above the present surface of the lake, but five and a-half feet below
its level previous to drainage; the largest of these consisted of a
heap, thirteen feet in diameter, of small flattish, angular-shaped
stones resting on peat; the small stones had a reddish colour, and
consisted of fragments of greywacke shale. Immediately contiguous
to this heap of small stones was another, about four feet in
diameter, made up of large stones, some a foot and a-half in
breadth. These larger blocks exhibited no trace of the action of
fire which had given to the smaller fragments their red colour.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p><i>Lough Ramor.</i>&mdash;There are numerous islands on this lake, which
is five miles in length, and from a mile to a mile and a-half in
breadth. In the <i>Irish Annals</i> this sheet of water is said to have
burst forth <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> 2859, and in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 845, King Malachy is reputed to
have here attacked and destroyed an island on which rebels had
fortified themselves after joining with the Danes, and from whence
they continued to commit depredations on the neighbouring districts.
On its shores was found the curious stone mould figured
<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_73">73</a>; a bronze vessel like a modern pot, eleven and a-half
inches high, and the same wide, with small handles attached below
the rim, and one foot wanting; another bronze vessel in a perfect
state, with three transverse raised lines on sides, trident-shaped
ornaments spring from the base of each leg, angular handles
attached between junction of rim and conical pot, fifteen and
three-quarter inches high, twelve across mouth. These latter articles
were both found in Lough Ramor, and in Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A.
they appear as Nos. 40 and 43.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Lough Crannog.</i>&mdash;Judging from the name, there was formerly
an artificial island in this lake.</p>

<p><i>Lough Aconnick</i> and <i>Derreskit Lough</i>.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>At a meeting of the Royal Historical and Archæological Association
of Ireland, held at Portrush, July, 1885, a paper on the
crannogs of the county Cavan was read by Mr. Seaton Milligan of
Belfast, who stated that he had at various times visited several of
those structures, which he considered to be more numerous in
Cavan than in any other county in Ireland, owing perhaps to the
great number of lakes scattered over its surface. He described
some eleven sites that lay within a radius of seven or eight miles
from the town of Cavan; and was of opinion that their outer row
of piling was generally formed of oak, and the inner circles of
smaller stakes of hazel and sallow. A looped spear-head of bronze
was shown by him, and he minutely described two canoes dug out
of a bog on the shores of a lake containing a crannog, and situated
near Heath Lodge. A bronze rapier found near a crannog in
Lough Oughter was also exhibited by him, and a description given
of the castle of the same name, where Bishop Bedell was protected
by the Irish during the troublous times of 1641. This castle stands
on an island surrounded by piling, and bearing the impress of
having been an ancient crannog whereon the more modern structure
was erected (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_155">155</a>).</p>

<p>The exact locality of two sites in the province of Ulster still
remains undefined, i.e. <i>Loch-da-damh</i> (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_158">158</a>), and the crannog
attacked by Sir Henry Sidney in 1566 (<i>ante</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_146">146-8</a>).</p>

<h4>COUNTY WESTMEATH.</h4>

<p>During the working of the Commission for the Arterial Drainage
of Ireland a crannog was discovered in this county, but its site
is unidentified.</p>

<p><i>Joristown.</i>&mdash;In this townland, parish of Killucan, there would
seem to have been formerly a crannog in the river Deel, for when
deepening the bed of the stream a bronze spear-head was found
five feet below the surface, and in the immediate neighbourhood
of an artificial island, which is described upon the label attached to
this weapon in the R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A. as “a little mound, formerly an island,
which contained a quantity of bones and some iron spears.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p><i>Ballinderry</i>, in the parish of Kilcumreragh, barony of Clonlonan,
is situated not far from Moate. When, as the result of
drainage, the water of this lake fell, it was discovered that it had
formerly contained a large crannog surrounded by a stockade of
oak piles, around and on which was an immense quantity of the
antlers of red deer, and fractured bones of deer, oxen, sheep, and
other mammalia, all afterwards sold as manure. Many objects of
archæological interest found here were obtained by various collectors&mdash;some
are in the Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A., and others have been
figured in the <i>Journal of the Royal Historical and Archæological
Association of Ireland</i>. The first notice of the crannog occurred in
1844, when Mr. Hayes forwarded to Sir W. Wilde a description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of it, together with a plan and map of the locality. Two single-piece
canoes were disinterred from this site, and portion of an
ancient harp of wood. The pendent amulet of stone, figured
p. <a href="#Page_115">115</a>, was found here.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p><i>Ballinacarriga.</i>&mdash;<i>Ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_136">136</a>.</p>

<p><i>Lough Owel.</i>&mdash;A canoe was here found, and a crannog is said
to exist beneath the waters of this lake, opposite Portlenon. It is
situated on a shallow, still called by the fishermen “the Old
Crannog.”</p>

<h4>COUNTY LONGFORD.</h4>

<p><i>Castle Forbes.</i>&mdash;<i>Ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_33">33</a>.</p>

<p><i>Aughamore</i>, near Granard.&mdash;At this place was said to have been
discovered a curious wooden hut, constructed of black bog-oak,
which lay under water in an exhausted bog at considerable depth
beneath the surface. It measured twenty-three feet by ten, and
had eight very strong beams supported by cross-beams firmly
jointed; the side-beams mortised, as if intended for uprights. It
was taken asunder in the process of raising, and as far as can be
ascertained it has never been viewed by any person competent to
form an opinion on the matter, so that no conjecture can be
hazarded regarding the age or purpose of this so-called hut.</p>

<h4>COUNTY LOUTH.</h4>

<p><i>Iniskeen.</i>&mdash;<i>Ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_158">158</a>.</p>

<p><i>Ballyhoe Lake.</i>&mdash;A stone pestle, an amulet made of black stone,
and a flat circular stone, were here found,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and from the bed of
the river <i>Glyde</i> were obtained a portion of a double comb and two
beads of bone, the one seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, the
other one-half inch wide.</p>

<h4>KING’S COUNTY.</h4>

<p>During the working of the Commission for the Arterial Drainage
of Ireland, a crannog was discovered in this county, locality
not mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> “Just above the Pass Bridge, at the east end of
Droughtville demesne, is a marsh, called the ‘Muddy Lake’ on
the Ordnance Map, but by the people, the ‘Island Lough.’ On
the north side of this marsh there is a small island, on which are
the remains of <i>Kiltubrid Castle</i>. Between the castle and mainland,
on the north side, there is an ancient causeway about one hundred
yards in length.” A new channel made by the Drainage Commissioners
in 1852, crossed this causeway within thirty yards of
the castle. In the excavation several large pieces of oak were
found, having evidently formed portion of a framework, as the
mortises were tolerably perfect. Here also were discovered an
article formed of wood, a pan of white bronze or <i>findruin</i>, three
coins of the reign of Charles I., two of Elizabeth, and numerous
others worn and defaced.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<h4>QUEEN’S COUNTY.</h4>

<p><i>Grantstown.</i>&mdash;About the year 1860, the permanent water-level
of this lake being lowered six feet, disclosed an artificial island;
the stakes forming the enclosure were very sharply pointed; those
laid horizontally in the centre were grooved and nailed together.
R. Langrishe&mdash;who had visited Grantstown, and was often on the
lake&mdash;states that the country people spoke of these remains as
“the castle”: they said “it had sunk.” No canoe was found,
the water in the immediate vicinity of the crannog being upwards
of eighty feet in depth. The only relics discovered were an iron
hasp, two nails with large heads, an arrow or spear of charred
wood, a polished piece of bone resembling a pin for the hair, having
grooved circles all round it at top, an enormous quantity of
animal bones and charred timber, a lump of gypsum, also a rude
box, about four and a-half feet in length, which contained two
small bones.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p><i>Lough Annagh</i>, situated in the barony of Tinnehinch, separates
the King’s from the Queen’s County; it is three miles in circumference,
and the waters abound with pike, roach, and perch. In
the middle of this lake, where most shallow, oak framing was
visible, and a tradition existed that “in the war of 1641 a party
of insurgents had a wooden house erected on this platform, whence
they went out at night in a boat and plundered the surrounding
country.” The site was suitable for such a retreat, the lake having
formerly been embowered in forest. Queen Elizabeth thanked
one of her commanders for conducting a detachment of horse in
safety through the surrounding woods of the district. T. Stanley,
who visited the place in 1868, observed an island-like patch rising
a little above the water-level; of piles then visible he counted
upwards of one hundred and twenty, arranged in lines, with spaces
of two feet between the alignments, the average diameter being
about five inches. The island sloped down gradually in every
direction, and the piles&mdash;apparent only on one side&mdash;accommodated
themselves to the slope, and were in general only a few inches
above the surface of the water. Four piles had been uprooted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and thus showed that originally they were pointed with a sharp
instrument, possibly with small iron hatchets similar to those
found on the spot a few days previous to T. Stanley’s visit. Between
the island and the shore there was a half-submerged space,
about thirty feet in diameter, strewn with stones and broken
querns; a few piles appeared among this debris. There was a
lesser tract closely adjoining, where well-burnt brick, both whole
and broken, were mingled with the stones. On the mainland, near
the crannog were traces of a curious bog-pass, made like an American
corduroy road, and there can be little doubt of this being
“the tougher of Malahone,” mentioned by Major Edward Wood
in his despatch, giving an account of an action fought by him on
the 4th May, 1691,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> when he defeated a portion of the Irish army
on a hill above the lough. It is more than probable that the
crannogs in question had either been the head-quarters of the
Irish force, or that after their defeat the fugitives took refuge on
the islands, for in the year 1868, the Rev. J. Graves saw at Tullamore
articles purchased from the men who had picked them up
near the crannog. The items first named seem to tell their own
story.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>During the progress of drainage operations, five canoes became
exposed to view; they lay at the bottom in the same part of the
lake, with their bow in a north-westerly direction, all having the
same inclination or dip in the sandy or muddy deposit. A drawing
was made, with measured plans and sections of the most perfect
of the “dug-outs”; it was, however, split or fissured from starboard
right through to the stern; it measured twenty-two feet
seven inches over all, its greatest beam being thirty-one inches.
It was formed out of one large trunk of oak, and appeared to have
been hollowed by means of fire; close inspection showed that
edged tools had been used in finishing it. The bottom (two inches
thick) was perfectly flat, and without keel, and its perfectly smooth
sides inclined outwards from the bottom. Two stout ridges of
solid timber, one near either end of the “dug-out,” served to
prevent the sides from collapsing, and between them and the bow
and stern cavities had been hollowed out of the solid trunk,
seemingly for the purpose of rendering the craft more buoyant.
The port side was several inches lower than the starboard&mdash;manifestly
the effect of accident. There were no traces of thwarts or
benches; the sides had neither row-locks nor thole-pins; the canoe
must therefore have been intended for propulsion by paddles. A
horizontal hole, about one and a-half inch in diameter, had been
bored in the most forward and highest part of the stern.</p>

<p>This entire fleet of ancient boats, together with several querns
and bones found in the locality, were, in 1868, at Brittas, the
residence of the Right Hon. General Dunn.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p><i>Cullina.</i>&mdash;Mr. Louis Orr states that in 1872 he saw exposed by
turf-cutters in the bog of Cullina, about three miles from Maryborough,
the remains of a primitive wooden dwelling. “The
building lay from ten to twelve feet beneat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>h the original surface
of the bog, and consisted chiefly of four upright posts, which
formed the angles of a square of six or seven feet across. These
posts were about six feet in height. A quantity of timber, consisting
of planks and trunks of trees, principally oak, lay scattered
around, and some of the woodwork appeared to have been charred
by fire. Within what had been the area of the hut was a trough
made of oak, measuring three feet in length by two in breadth.”
A piece of thin metal (whether bronze or iron is not stated), very
much corroded, was also discovered. It was supposed to have been
a sword.</p>

<p><i>Lough Nahinch</i> (the lake of the island).&mdash;In the year 1810 the
waters of this lake, situated near Roscrea (at the junction of King’s
County and Tipperary), having been lowered four feet by drainage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
a considerable portion of the land it once covered (<a href="#fig211">fig. 211,
<i>b b b b b</i></a>) was laid bare, and the site of a crannog became apparent.
The lake is now much reduced in dimensions, but the surrounding
ground being low, its expanse in winter (<a href="#fig211"><i>a a</i></a>) is greater than in
summer. Mr. Trench of Cangort Park&mdash;although at the time of
its discovery unaware of the real nature of the construction&mdash;gave
the following graphic description of it:&mdash;“The bottom (of the
lake) consists of blue shelly marl, which seems to extend to a great
depth, and when dry it is exceedingly light. In the highest part
of this reclaimed land, which is about the middle of the old lake,
there is seen a circular part resembling in shape the top of an immense
tub, about sixty feet in diameter. The large planks which
form the staves are from one to ten feet (?) broad, and six inches
thick, quite straight as far as it has yet been possible to trace them
downwards; none of them have been raised without cutting them.”
There was no appearance of either axe or saw having been used in
their formation.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Since the change in the water level, the original aspect of
the crannog has been completely transformed, its circular shape
changed, many of the piles removed, and where the water was
deep a quay was built for the convenience of landing turf from
the southern shore. On the east there was a track into the mainland
(<i>c</i>), and at its junction with the quay at the S.E. of the
island, was one of the old oak sheeting piles. On the north, oak
piles were noted forming part of a circle, and from them, running
S. and S.E., there were two rows of round perpendicular ash piles
(two feet five inches in diameter), that may have formed part of
walls, or partitions dividing the space inside the circle of sheet piles
into rooms or dwellings. On the N.W. of the island, about three
yards from the present shore, were also some of the circle of sheet
piles, and between them and the land ran E. and W. beams four
feet apart, and four feet lower than the surface of the island:
above these were irregularly-laid logs of oak, mingled with large
stones. On the S.W. there was a set of oak sheet piles bounding
the end of the quay. Only the general section of the island could
be made on account of the inrush of water into the excavation.</p>

<p>The artificial work, measured from the present surface, was
more than five feet six inches in thickness. On the beams (<i>layer
2 in section</i>) there seemed to have been a basket flooring, but of
this there could not be certainty, owing to the depth of water in
the excavation. In connexion with them were observed <i>wicker-walls</i>
made of hazel rods, and where these crossed the oak beams
there were round holes through the latter for the stakes to pass
through. In the vicinity of these beams a small rude stone implement
of Silurian grit was found, but so rotten that it broke
when handled. The beams in <i>layer</i> 3 were charred on the under
surface, as if they had formed the rafters of an edifice destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
by fire. Near the north of the island, immediately over these
charred beams, there was a plank pointing N.W. and S.E.; it was
ten feet long, twenty inches wide, and two inches thick; at about
one foot nine inches from its N.W. end there were two holes
through it, running N. and S. in a line with the north and south
piles seen on the N. shore, and on each side of the plank there
were upright stakes ranging in the same direction. The conclusion
may be drawn that the island was occupied at two distinct
periods&mdash;the first being when the E. and W. beams formed the
floor of the habitations which seemed to have been destroyed by
fire: afterwards the oak sticks and stones&mdash;irregularly laid&mdash;were
placed as a floor for new dwellings, and between the periods
it must be supposed that the water of the lake had risen considerably.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p><i>Ardmore Bay.</i>&mdash;Here, in the year 1879, a submarine crannog
was discovered on the shore under high water-mark, where a small
stream runs into the sea between
Ardmore chapel and the
old coastguard houses; this
little stream described a semicircle
around the crannog at
low water, but at high water
all was submerged; a bank of
shingle had covered it in whole
or in part, but the rapid denudation
going on from the action
of the sea had removed
the shingle and is wearing
down the bed of turf, so that
it is quite possible no remains
of the crannog may be left.
Its greatest diameter was from
ninety-two to one hundred feet: the turf was over nine feet
deep where the piles were driven in; these were of oak, rud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>ely
pointed and forming a double enceinte&mdash;irregularly oval in shape&mdash;of
which the inner row of piles generally sloped slightly inwards,
and those of the outer row&mdash;closer together and more
numerous than the inner&mdash;sloped outwards. In many cases they
stood above the turf, and were for the most part large&mdash;as thick as
a man’s thigh. Several smaller piles were in the S.E. quarter of
the crannog, probably the remains of wattled partitions. To the
N.E. the sea denudation had been very great, and there, at the
surface, were found many roots of bog-timber, similar to those
which near the centre of the crannog lay more than two feet
below the level of the solid peat.</p>

<p>In the peat Nos. 1, 2, and 3, roots and twigs of oak occurred,
and in the peat Nos. 6 and 8 were many twigs and boughs of oak,
also stouter pieces of sallow. The cross-section taken along the

piles, hazel stakes, planks, beams, &amp;c., found in the excavation,
also the high water-mark of average spring tides, and the depth
of the peat&mdash;where proved. Any implements, or other relics that
may have remained in this site, must have been long since washed
away. A few antiquities are said to have been discovered in the
Ardmore peat, but not within the bounds of the crannog, so that
some charcoal found in one spot, two feet below the surface, and
the “kitchen midden”&mdash;which at the close of 1880 became exposed
by the action of the sea&mdash;form the only traces remaining of
man’s former presence in this abode.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>On Arranmore island, in the Bay of Galway, the Rev. W.
Kilbride discovered habitations and artificial structures extending
from above high water-mark to under the low water-level of spring
tides: from this it may be inferred that man existed in Ireland
before the last subsidence of the land. The <i>Irish Annals</i> contain
much that was formerly looked upon as fabulous relations of inbreaks
of the ocean, but which may be reasonably held to be the
reflex of traditionary tales having some foundation in fact. Geologists
assert that at one time Great Britain and Ireland were
connected with the Continent by a great level plain, over which
roamed the <i>Megaceros</i>, so that even within the period of the existence
of this animal, whose contemporaneity with man may be
considered beyond dispute, both seas and continents have changed.</p>

<p>There are proofs of elevation and subsidence in the Bay of
Baiæ, where the Temple of Jupiter Serapis “affords in itself alone
unequivocal evidence that the relative level of land and sea have
changed twice at Puzzuoli since the beginning of the Christian
era; and each movement, both of elevation and subsidence, has
exceeded twenty feet.”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> It is difficult to decide whether the
crannog at Ardmore had, like the Temple of Jupiter, subsided
with the land, and had again been elevated: the denudation of
the crannog may point to the possibility of the latter hypothesis.</p>

F. R. S. The lower part of its socket was ornamented
with gold (see figs. <a href="#fig214">214</a> and <a href="#fig215">215</a>). Homer
more than once mentions the gold ring, or ferrule,
around the spear-head of Hector. The two following
relics&mdash;also from Lough Gur&mdash;may be seen
in the British Museum:&mdash;(1) A moiety of a stone
mould for casting spear-heads and other pointed
objects of various sizes: “it is a four-sided prism,
six and a-half inches long, and two and a half
inches broad at one end of each face, and one and
three-quarter inches at the other. A second similar
prism would, it has been observed, give four perfect
moulds for casting spear-heads slightly varying in
form, but in each case provided with side-loops.
These loops are, as usual, semicircular in form on
the mould, and were no doubt destined
to be flattened in the usual manner by
a subsequent process of hammering.
There is one special feature in this
mould, viz., that at the base of the
blade there is a transverse notch in the
stone, evidently destined to receive a
small pin which would serve to keep
the core for the socket in its proper
position. There is a similar transverse
notch in one of the smaller moulds
for the pointed objects”<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> (<a href="#fig216">fig. 216</a>). (2) An iron sword, which

<h4>COUNTY CLARE.</h4>

<p><i>Effernan.</i>&mdash;In the year 1873, a gentleman desirous to provide
his residence with an ample supply of water, decided on bringing
it down from this lake, situated at a distance of about two miles,
and at a level of three hundred feet above his house. Before a
syphon could be placed in working order, it was necessary to reduce
the height of the water much below its ordinary summer level,
which was effected by clearing and deepening the outlet. When
making the cutting the labourers, at about six feet below the
surface, came upon a densely-intertwined layer of roots of a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>pine
forest; the trees had evidently attained maturity in the position
in which they were found, and they extended also under the
water. The forest must have been very ancient, as no lake could
have been formed there at the time of its existence. The roots
were in the exact position in which the trees grew, and these, with
the direction to which their stumps pointed, seemed to indicate that,
while the present prevailing wind is the S.W., it must then have
been the N.W. Hills and valleys guide the aerial currents, and
some convulsion of the earth’s crust may have altered these, and
formed the present lake. When, by drainage, the water had been
reduced nine feet, there was laid bare a low neck of land stretching
into the lake, its outer end being highest. Along this neck of land
ran, in irregular order, a row of posts, from four to six inches
in diameter, and which, in general, only just topped the ground.
At the extremity of the promontory was an unmistakable crannog,
circular in form, and with wooden piles surrounding the exterior;
the floor was of stone; and one large flag&mdash;seemingly the fireplace&mdash;took
up the greater part of the interior space. Unfortunately,
no one specially interested about lake dwellings was at the
time aware of this discovery, and the syphon being completed,
crannog and causeway became once more submerged.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p><i>Ballinlough</i> is situated in the barony of Leitrim, and parish of
Ballinakill; in it were four islands, bearing no distinctive appellation;
but G. H. Kinahan, who made the explorations, named
them, respectively&mdash;<i>North Island</i> (1), (<a href="#fig217">fig. 217</a>), <i>West Island</i> (2),
<i>Middle Island</i> (3), <i>East Island</i> (4). In the general view of the
lake (<a href="#fig218">fig. 218</a>), <i>North Island</i> (1) is in the far distance; near the
mouth of the rivulet is <i>West Island</i> (2); to its right lies <i>Middle
Island</i> (3); whilst a glimpse of a portion only of <i>East Island</i> (4) is
to be seen. The horns and skulls of numerous red deer have been
discovered at various times in the lake-bed; also the head and
horns of a <i>Megaceros hibernicus</i>. <i>North Island</i> (1) is nearly one
hundred yards from the shore, to which, during the dry season,
it was connected by a reedy bank, and, when visited, was a foo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>t
above the surface of the water; the excavation was stopped on
finding the stratum undisturbed, and no traces around of ancient
dwellings, either of stone, or of piling. <i>West Island</i> (2), twenty-six
yards from the shore, was connected with it during the dry
season; its form was a rude oval, the diameter thirty-three and
fifteen yards, respectively, and there were flat stones round the
outside. An excavation in the centre showed:&mdash;</p>

it was almost circular, its diameter being thirty-two yards; and
outside, for a width of nearly twelve feet, it was lined with regularly-placed
flat stones. When the water was low, piles could be
distinctly observed around it; but the porous nature of the materials,
joined to the height of the water at the time, precluded a

<p>The oak beams were sawn, not split; they seemed to run nearly
N. and S.; through them, at distances of nine inches, were pairs
of dowels, and at intervals of nine inches were ash poles, two and
a-half inches thick, through which the dowels passed and secured
the flooring beams. The wicker-work flooring was formed of hazel
rods; and the crannog would appear to have been divided into
huts, or apartments, as portion of a row of ash piles was observable.
Below the beams there was a stratum of peat; but in
consequence of the rapid influx of water, the working had to be
abandoned at this point. No relics were discovered, owing probably
to the narrow area of the excavation. <i>East Island</i> (4) was
of irregular pear-shape, sixty-seven yards by fifty; it lay three
hundred feet from the southern shore, and seemed to be partly
natural, partly artificial. An excavation in the centre gave four
feet of peat, and under it was shell marl, whilst for a radius of
about twelve feet around the island there were layers of regularly-placed
stones, small and flat; also at the S.E. shore there were two
beams, seven inches wide; the height of the water, however, precluded
further examination.</p>

<p>The lake occupied a hollow among low hills, the only outlet
being at the village of Ballinlough, where there is an artificial cut
through a bank of coarse boulder clay. If this cut were filled up,
the water would rise at least four feet higher than at present; and
it would seem to have been at that level not long since, for all
round the beach, to over that height, there is a deposit of shell
marl and peat. In the bank of drift on the west of the village is
the trace of an ancient ravine, <i>artificially filled up</i> with stuff taken
from an oblong excavation (marked <i>a</i> on <a href="#fig217">fig. 217</a>). To account
for this artificial filling, it may be suggested that the inhabitants
of the crannogs were flooded out by an enemy, who stopped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
egress of the lake, thus raising the water until the islands were
swamped; after this they remained submerged until the opening
of the present cut. In later years they had been occasionally occupied
for purposes of illicit distillation.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p><i>Lough Naneevin</i> is situated in the townland of Gortacarnam,
barony of Moycullen. In the summer of 1865, G. H. Kinahan
observed, in this lake, a crannog which is described as oval in
form, about one hundred and fifty feet in length, seventy-five feet
wide, and on the south a narrow causeway, then partly submerged,
had joined it to the mainland. The island bore traces of having
(since last inhabited) been covered with water <i>at least</i> two feet
higher, for shell marl was deposited on the portion below that
level. On the south shore of the crannog there was a row of
round oak piles, four inches in diameter, and on the S.W. shore
were two rows of similar piles, five feet apart; alongside them
were oak beams, and there was a double row of piles, seemingly
part of a wall, bearing north and south. No piles were observable
on the east of the crannog, but there was an irregularly-laid flooring
of beams of ash, oak, and sallow; from these latter, it was
supposed, had sprouted the sallow trees, which at that time formed
a fringe round the island. The piles had been pointed with a
sharp-cutting instrument; therefore metal had been in use either
when the crannog was constructed, or repaired.</p>

<p>Six small excavations made near the centre of the island, where
the surface of the crannog was three feet above the water-level,
disclosed the following section:&mdash;</p>

<p>About a foot below the water-level were traces of what G. H.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>Kinahan considered to be a basket-flooring; and a large flag-stone,
used as a hearth, was found resting on an accumulation of wood-ashes,
three feet in depth. Some distance to the west was a long
rude bench (or perhaps the foundation of a wall) formed of stones.
The height of the water prevented excavations outside the crannog,
therefore few bones were met with, but a little east of the fireplace
was the probable site of the kitchen midden.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p><i>Loughrea</i> is situated in the barony of same name. In the
locality there lingered a tradition that a city lay buried under
this lake, and indeed on a clear calm day&mdash;where the waters are
shallow&mdash;there may be observed various heaps of stones, placed
with a degree of regularity that renders it probable they may be
remains of ancient lake dwellings. Upon examination it was
ascertained that four of the islands in the lough were undoubted
crannogs, and it was quite possible that another (known as Blake
Island) might prove to be also of artificial formation.</p>

<p><i>Reed Island</i>, situated at the N.W. corner of the lake, about
fifty yards from the shore, lies too low to be observable in any
picture. Excavations showed (section, <a href="#fig219">fig. 219</a>)&mdash;(6) marl; (5)
peat; (4) large stones; (3) a layer of birch trunks and branches;
(2 and 1) two layers of squared oak beams, laid at right angles to
each other. The island was surrounded with a circle of piles
(<a href="#fig219">fig. 219</a>)&mdash;two feet apart&mdash;that were seemingly strengthened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
against wave action by a layer of flat stones, deposited with great
regularity; three sets of piles crossed the crannog, which rose
about six inches above the ordinary level of the lake, and the
lowest beams (1 in section) were four feet two inches beneath the
then water surface. The island originally consisted of a wooden
platform, enclosed by “a circular wall, the framework of which
was the piles, the interstices being filled with sods. As the lake
rose, it was found necessary to raise the floor, first by a mass of
birch timbers and branches, and afterwards by a layer of stones.”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p><i>Shore Island</i>, situated immediately below Lord Dunlo’s house,
and a quarter of a mile from Reed Island, appears to have been
formerly connected with the mainland by a causeway formed of
marl and peat; but in comparatively recent times the waters of the
lake have worn a gap through it, about fifteen yards in breadth.
(<a href="#plate49">Plate <span class="smcapuc">XLIX.</span>, figs. 220 to 223.</a>) The S.S.E. and E. shores were
found to be a mass of stone, between and outside two semicircles of
oak piles, whilst the W. and N. were banked up with shell marl.
Twenty yards south of the island, three circles of piles, three feet
apart, could on a calm day be seen below the water. Thirty-five
feet from the E. shore part of a circle of piles was visible under
the water, being perhaps portion of the circle found in the most
northern excavation made. From the east shore a double row of
piles extended from the circle, and on the north of these were
horizontal beams in parallel line. A little N.W. of the double
row, in an old working, there was part of a circle of piles, and in
another a row of piles running nearly E. and W. Some of the
upright piles formerly bore marks showing that horizontal beams
had been mortised on them. This settlement was thoroughly explored,
and in it basket-flooring and partitions were noticed (<i>ante</i>,
p. <a href="#Page_32">32</a>). In 1848, among the numerous bones raised from this
site were perfect crania of oxen, sheep, goats, deer, pigs, and what
seemed to be those of large dogs, or wolves, together with the head
of a <i>Megaceros hibernicus</i>, measuring over thirteen feet from tip to
tip of the antlers.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

</div>

<p><i>Ash Island</i> (figs. <a href="#fig220">220</a> and <a href="#fig224">224</a>) is sixty yards from the shore at the
south-west corner of the lake. When examined, the surface above
water measured twenty yards in diameter, and it was covered with
flat stones, which continued for a short distance under the water.
Towards the S. W. a spur, covered with small shingle, extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
outwards about three yards, and to the N. and S. W. were similar
spurs stretching to a distance of four yards from the water edge.
On the N. E. there were visible, below the water, a number of
parallel logs of round ash, six inches in diameter, and two feet
apart; also one or two logs on the east side. A few piles of oak were
discovered; there were no indications, however, that the island
had at any time been surrounded by a regular piling, but there
was found a wicker, or dividing wall, the stakes composed of round
fir, two inches in diameter, and one foot apart. The finds consisted
merely of fractured bones, wood ashes, hazel-nuts, two hones,
and a round sea-stone.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 225.&mdash;View of Loughrea, Island M’Coo in the distance.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Island M’Coo</i> is one hundred and eighty yards from the nearest
shore. It seemed to be surrounded by a circle of piles thirty-five
feet in diameter, and in a season of low water <i>gun-barrels</i> and
<i>bronze spear-heads</i> were said to have been brought up in the prongs
of eel-spears. The incongruity of the juxta-position of gun-barrels
and bronze spear-heads can easily be explained. In the year 1798
all the guns seized throughout the surrounding country were
brought into the town of Loughrea, and the magistrate in charge,
having orders to destroy them, caused them to be carried out and
sunk in the lake. At the east side of the island were observed
traces of four canoes with their prows turned towards the shore.
An attempt to raise one of them&mdash;a single-piece canoe of oak&mdash;failed,
it being so decomposed that it broke across in the middle.</p>

<p>The age of these crannogs was estimated to be over 1800 years,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>or before the Christian era. When they were first constructed the
surface of the lake must have been at least seven feet lower, and at
a subsequent period the west part of the lake must have been
twelve feet deeper. The change in the level of the water was
caused by the silting up of its outlet. The ancient stream from
the lake seems to have been at the west end of the town of
Loughrea, where is an alluvial deposit; whilst at its modern outlet
there is strong corn gravel, and a little below its present bed there
seems to be rock. The town is more than four hundred years old,
and since that date the water could scarcely have changed its level,
because the eastern outlet of the lake ran at the foot of the town
wall; and thus forming part of the town defences, the inhabitants
would have kept the stream free.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 226.&mdash;General view of the Crannog of Loughannaderriga, Achill Island.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Loughannaderriga.</i>&mdash;There are, doubtless, many persons who,
if asked to point out the exact position of Achill, would be unable
to do so, yet it contains an area of about thirty-six thousand acres,
and a population which may be reckoned by thousands. Here,
two miles from the village of Doogort, is an “imperium in imperio,”
an island within an island, and this is believed to be, at present,
the only authenticated crannog in Mayo, to which county Achill
Island belongs. Loughannaderriga (<i>the lakelet of the oaks</i>) is
about two hundred yards in diameter, and in shape somewhat inclined
to an oval; it is environed by abrupt banks of peat, which,
in recent years, have considerably encroached on the water-area.
The bottom consists of deep, treacherous mud, so that an exploration
could only be attempted by aid of planks, and even then
a cursory examination was alone found practicable, the water not
having been withdrawn by drainage.</p>

<p>Of the crannog, the diameter is about sixty feet; its exterior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>face so worn away by wave action, that the traces of the outer row
of piling are now some feet distant. The Irish-speaking natives
still call it the <span class="gaelic">Crannogh</span>, and in English designate it “the island”;
its surface is covered with a luxuriant growth of bilberry and
<i>Osmunda regalis</i>. An excavation showed&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A natural growth of peat, about three and a-half feet thick.</p>

<p>2. A layer of branches.</p>

</div>

<p>Some feet from the exterior face of the crannog, on the side
shown in <a href="#fig226">fig. 226</a>, numerous pointed ends of stakes, evidently
dressed with a sharp metallic tool, were extracted from the mud
(<a href="#fig227">fig. 227, No. 1</a>), and a large portion of another (<a href="#fig227">No. 4</a>) lay on
the beach. A fragment of a beam, mortised at one extremity,
was found in close proximity (<a href="#fig227">No. 6</a>); its quadrangular incision,
which did not quite penetrate the plank, was saucer-shaped at
bottom, and an unique arrangement of a peg-hole in each corner
shows the firm manner in which it had been originally secured:
it probably belonged to the framework of the crannog hut. Not
far from this was part of the blade of a canoe paddle (<a href="#fig227">No. 5</a>),
the bottom of a wooden vessel, one side bearing traces of fire
(<a href="#fig227">No. 2</a>), and a stave (most likely of the same utensil), pierced for
reception of the handle (<a href="#fig227">No. 3</a>). There were also several nonde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>script
portions of worked timber, numerous chips, pieces of
charred wood, and a couple of white sling-stones, consisting
of water-worn sea-beach pebbles. Deeply imbedded
in the mud was a large whetstone (<a href="#fig228">fig. 228</a>), much worn
on three sides by the friction of whetting, and bearing
deep and sharp indentations produced by the edges of
metallic tools; the fourth side presents the natural
surface of the stone.</p>

Golden-bronze
Pin. Full size.</p>
</div>

<p>The most interesting “find” was a bronze pin
(<a href="#fig229">fig. 229</a>), very sharp at point, the superior portion of
the acus ornamented with a row of circular indentations,
and the flattened head pierced with a round
hole, through which passed a thin golden-bronze loop,
of material so fragile that it crumbled away when
touched. The pin itself was covered with a thick
coating of “patina” and boggy sediment, which at
once scaled off; it is composed of early and pure
bronze called “golden,” from its resemblance to the
precious metal, and it is of the type of those found
in the ancient <i>Emania</i> destroyed in the third century.
There were no traces of either bones or pottery; as the
probable level, on which they might be expected to rest,
was not reached.</p>

<h4>COUNTY ROSCOMMON.</h4>

<p>Twelve crannogs were discovered in this county during the
working of the Commission for the Arterial Drainage of Ireland:
these sites have all been identified.</p>

<p><i>Loughlea.</i>&mdash;A flint mass, a piece of a circular grindstone, a
fragment of a bone spike, two portions of the blades of iron
swords, and an antique-shaped iron key, were here brought to
light. There were three crannog sites in this lake.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p><i>Muckenagh.</i>&mdash;Ante, p. <a href="#Page_154">154</a>.</p>

<p><i>Derreen Lake.</i>&mdash;There were here found an iron hatchet and
a pair of stirrup irons.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p><i>Kilglass.</i><a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>&mdash;Of this site the name alone is given.</p>

<p><i>Cloonfree</i>, <i>Cloonfinlough.</i>&mdash;In the year 1852, by the operation
of drainage works in the vicinity of Strokestown, the level of
the three lakes of Cloonfree,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Cloonfinlough, and Ardakillen was
greatly lowered, and one artificial islet in the first-named sheet of
water, and two in Cloonfinlough were laid bare. Of the latter, one
island was one hundred and thirty feet in diameter, constructed
on oak piles driven into the soft marl at regular distances, bound
together by horizontal oak stretchers forming a triple stockade,
with an interval of five feet between each. To the N. W. were
a number of irregularly-placed piles, stretching a short distance
from the islet. The centre of the stockades was laid with trunks
of small oak-trees, placed flat on the marl; they all pointed to
a common centre, thus forming a platform whereon the island
itself was constructed. When first observed, there was jutting
out from the island, towards the west, a kind of jetty or pier,
formed of a double row of piles and stretchers running parallel,
and about eight feet asunder, on which logs of timber were laid
closely and horizontally.</p>

<p>In a short time very little of either the gangway or stockades remained,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>so much had been broken up and removed by the peasantry.
A trench&mdash;twenty feet long by five wide&mdash;having been cut as
near the centre of the island as possible, there was found, at about
eight inches under the surface, a very closely-laid pavement of
irregular-sized boulder stones; then a stratum of black earth, with
occasional fragments of bones through it, became exposed, and
about six inches beneath this was a considerable layer of burnt
earth, with several inches of unburnt clay under it. It is evident
that the height of the island had been raised and a new surface
pavement laid, for then came a second very closely-laid floor of
large-sized, flat-surfaced stones, beneath which were alternate layers
of black earth, burnt clay, and marl, reaching down to the log flooring,
and interspersed, like the one above it, with occasional bones
and fragments of bones. A human skull, and portions of others,
were got on the exterior edge. Between the island and the ruined
church were found two single-piece oak canoes, little more than
two feet wide, the stern of one being perforated with numerous
auger holes about an inch in diameter.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Close to the island were numerous articles of a miscellaneous
description, some of great antiquity, others of more modern date;
also a deposit of bones of <i>Bos longifrons</i>, <i>Cervus elaphus</i>, <i>Equus
caballus</i>, <i>Sus scrofa</i>, <i>Capra hircus</i>, fallow deer, sheep, fowl, dogs, &amp;c.
One or two osseous fragments, said to be human, were found in
the lowest stratum, together with splintered bones and horns of
the <i>Megaceros hibernicus</i>. Traces of this great “Bighorn” have
(as already noticed) been found also in the crannog of Breagho, in
the lacustrine settlement in Loughrea, and in Ballinlough, <i>i.e.</i> in
connection with four crannog sites, whilst the exploration of the
cave of Ballynamintra,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> situated near Cappagh, county Waterford,
has proved the contemporaneity of man with the <i>Megaceros</i>.
In that cave, and lying but a little over the stratum which contained
the bones of the <i>Megaceros</i>, was found the bone handle of
what, judging from its ferruginous colour, appeared to have been
an iron blade.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

Bronze Lamp, from Cloonfinlough.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>Amongst the bronze relics, not the least remarkable was a lamp,
of which the accompanying illustration affords a correct idea. It
measures in extreme length four
inches and five-eighths. The bottom
was perforated, evidently for
the admission of a support or stand,
up or down which the lamp could
have been slid to suit the convenience
of anyone using it. Lamps fashioned in this way are
still in common use in Italy. The aperture to admit a stand has
been covered by a small plate of iron about the thickness of a
shilling. A similar lamp in the collection of Celtic antiquities
formed by the late Dean Dawson, as well as the Cloonfinlough
specimen, are now in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy.
The design is graceful and classic, so much so, indeed, as to suggest
the idea that the little object may have formed portion of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>a
spoil taken from Britain at a time while yet Roman influence
there prevailed. Raids by the Irish on the coasts of Britain were
very frequent, from whence they generally returned laden with
spoil: this may account for traces of Roman civilization discovered
in Ireland, for hoards of Roman coin have been unearthed in
various localities.</p>

<p><i>Ardakillen.</i>&mdash;In this lake one of the four crannogs discovered
was constructed of both stones and oak piling. <a href="#fig231">Fig. 231</a> represents
a section of this island. The upper line (<a href="#fig231"><i>a</i></a>) shows the former

<p>Under a slight earthy deposit there was a deep layer of loose
stones, bounded by an enclosing wall, the foundation supported
by piling. The lower portion of the island consisted of clay, peat,
and stones, mingled with strata of ashes, bones, and logs of timber.
The various rows of oak-piling are shown in the section; the sheet-piling,
driven in obliquely, formed an unbroken circle round the
island. When the level of the lake was lowered, four islands
became visible, and on the largest upwards of fifty tons of bones
were found: this is probably the crannog mentioned in the <i>Irish
Annals</i>, under dates 1368 and 1388 (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_154">154</a>). The scene
which this site presented shortly after the lowering of the water-level
was very remarkable; scores of persons visited it, at first in
search of bones, for which they found a ready sale as manure, and
afterwards with the view of picking up antiques, with which the
bog-matter around the sheet-piling or stockade was plentifully
studded. Large numbers of these were disposed of to an English
collector, and amongst the objects known to have been obtained by
him was a beautifully-formed vessel of wood, bound round with
plates of thin golden bronze, upon which a variety of designs were
displayed.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> What appears to have been a very similar article
was found many years ago in deepening the bed of the Kinnegad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
river, and is figured (p. 67) in Wilde’s <i>Boyne and Blackwater</i>.
A “dug out,” eighteen feet in length, discovered lying on the
bottom of the lake, was wantonly destroyed, and ultimately
utilised for firewood. Near the crannog was a canoe, forty
feet in length, and four feet across the bow; it was hollowed out
of a single trunk of oak, and in it were a skull, a spear-head,
and a bronze pin. The skull bears the mark of no less than
twenty sword-cuts, showing the murderous conflict in which its
owner must have been engaged. Near it was found a neck-piece
of iron with twenty feet of rude chain attached<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> (<a href="#fig232">fig. 232</a>).
Another set of “irons” (<a href="#fig233">fig. 233</a>) came from a crannog in the
immediate neighbourhood, and from the size it is likely they were
intended for ankle-fetters; it is stated that similar instruments
have elsewhere occurred in Irish lacustrine sites, and, stra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>nge to
say, in one instance there were traces of gilding. In Irish MSS.
allusions frequently occur to the practice of putting captives in
fetters; they were sometimes so severely manacled as to produce
almost unbearable torture. Prisoners were often slain when fettered.
One instance, though a comparatively modern one, will
suffice:&mdash;According to the <i>Annals of Loch Cé</i>, in the year 1585,
a son of Teige O’Rorke, and a son of Magnus Oge O’Currin, were
captured, “placed in irons on <i>Loch-na-cula</i>,” in the county Leitrim,
and slain.</p>

<p>The skull found lying in the bottom of the canoe was of the
oval or elliptical (<i>Dolicho cephalic</i>) type, characteristic of the natives
of western or southern Europe. There is a theory that in primeval
times in Erin there were two races, each distinctly marked
both by features and the form of the cranium. The one possessed
thick elliptical skulls, low foreheads, deep orbits, high cheek-bones,
prominent mouths, and narrow chins; the other had round, or
globular (<i>Brachi cephalic</i>) skulls, possessed more intellect, and less
marked features. Wilde observes that the two fragments of human
skulls discovered in the crannog of Lagore<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_204">204</a>)
partook of the character of the long-headed race, whilst the antiquities
found with them would lead to the belief that the persons
to whom the skulls had belonged did not live later than the tenth
century. Good examples of both races may still be seen amongst
the modern Irish.</p>

<p>“There are reasons for considering that the Ardakillen skull
belonged to a young adult, or to a man in the prime of life. This
opinion is based upon the fact that the coronal and sagittal sutures
were not obliterated. (The coronal suture is the name given to
the line of articulation between the frontal and parietal bones; it
forms a <i>vertical transverse</i> line over the top of the front of the
skull. The sagittal, or interparietal suture, occupies a <i>median
longitudinal</i> position between the two parietal bones.) The coalescence
into one plate of bone (calvarium, or skull-cap) of the
frontal and the two parietal bones, and the consequent obliteration
of the sutures (coronal and sagittal), generally occurs between
thirty and forty years of age; however, the period at which this
union commences, and the order in which it proceeds, is subject to
so much variation, that no more than an approximation to the ag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>e
of the skull is attainable thereby.</p>

<p>“Examination of the teeth remaining in one side of the upper
jaw&mdash;the opposite side of the jaw was broken away&mdash;showed that
the third molar tooth (<i>dens sapientiæ</i>) had been erupted.</p>

<p>“The many marks of cutting instruments upon the skull were
found chiefly over the vertex and the frontal and occipital regions.
In many the force had been applied at right angles to the cranium,
resulting in nicks or linear marks; in several horizontally, so as to
slice or shave off a portion of the outer table of the bone. In no
case was there a perforation of the inner table apparent, nor a
fracture or fissure of the entire thickness of the skull, whence it
might be inferred that the weapons were not of any great weight;
the force of the blows might have been broken by protecting headgear,
thick coils of matted hair, or by defensive movements of the
arms. There were no appearances to negative the idea that all,
or the majority of, the cuts were received about the same date.
They have all the characters of <i>ante mortem</i> injuries, as contrasted
with such injuries as the skull is liable to from rough usage, or
from its being knocked about. From the distribution of the marks
it may be assumed that the man was in an upright or semi-upright
position. In the hacking of a dead and prostrate enemy the
wounds would be on the part of the head which was uppermost.</p>

<p>“Though there is no single wound which must have proved
fatal <i>ex necessitate rei</i>, death might have ensued from the accumulation
of injuries, from concussion, erysipelas, or secondary inflammation
of the brain or its membranes.”<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<h4>COUNTY LEITRIM.</h4>

<p>Twenty crannogs were discovered in this county during the
working of the Commission for the arterial drainage of Ireland:
these sites have all been identified.</p>

<p><i>Drumaleague</i> may be cited as a good example of a lacustrine
dwelling: the form circular, and, with the exception of the
hearth-stones, it was composed wholly of wood, principally
alder. Drumaleague lake, situated in the vicinity of Lough
Scur, was originally about a mile in length. The level of the
water having been lowered thirteen feet, two crannogs became
visible, as also a canoe&mdash;hollowed out of a single trunk of oak&mdash;eighteen
feet long, twenty-two inches broad, square at stem and
stern, and having apertures or row-locks cut in the sides.</p>

</div>

<p>The annexed plan of one of the islands conveys a good idea
of the general arrangement of this class of structure. The outer
line of stakes enclosed a circle sixty feet in diameter, and within
the enclosure there were groups of stakes&mdash;in some parts two or
three deep&mdash;driven into the ground, seemingly for purposes connected
with some internal arrangement. <a href="#fig234">A</a>, the central oblong
portion, consists of a platform of round logs cut in lengths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
from four to six feet, possibly the floor of the hut; <a href="#fig234">B</a>, a collection
of stones with marks of fire on them; <a href="#fig234">C</a>, a heap of stiff clay;
<a href="#fig234">D</a>, the root of a large tree nearly buried in the peat, the surface
of the wood bevelled off, so as to form a sort of table, under
which was found a considerable quantity of bones, apparently
those of deer and swine.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig235">Fig. 235</a> is a section of the second crannog, which was surrounded
by a tolerably regular circular enclosure formed of a
single row of oak stakes <a href="#fig235">F, F</a>; it was seventy-two feet in diameter.
The upper stratum <a href="#fig235">B</a>, consisted of horizontal logs of
alder, reposing upon a black peaty surface; the logs were from
three to eight inches in diameter, completely water soaked and
rotten: this stratum of timber was three feet six inches deep.
<a href="#fig235">A</a>, a heap of stones with marks of fire on them. Other hearths
were found in different parts of the island. <a href="#fig235">C</a>, the lower stratum
of decayed and blackened sticks and branches of all descriptions
lying in every direction: this layer extended as far as it was
pierced in the examination, viz., about four feet, but was evidently
of greater depth. <a href="#fig235">D, D</a>, two heaps of stones found in the lower
stratum. <a href="#fig235">E</a>, the kitchen midden, in which was a large quantity
of bones of deer, swine, oxen, &amp;c., that lay four feet below the
surface. There was here found also the thin topstone of a quern,
formed of micaceous quartzite, smooth upon the grinding surface,
but otherwise rude and unfinished: the hole for the handle passes
quite through; the grain-hole, two and a-half inches in diameter,
is not directly in the centre.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p><i>Lough Scur.</i>&mdash;This crannog is alluded to in the <i>Annals of
Loch Cé</i>, under the following dates:&mdash;1345, four sons of <i>Cathal
Mac-in-caich Mac Raghnaill</i> were taken prisoners on <i>Loch-an-Scuir</i>,
and put to death; 1390, O’Rorke, who had been in confinement,
escaped to the castle of <i>Loch-an-Scuir</i>, but was overtaken and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
slain “when coming out of his cott”; 1580, <i>Loch-an-Scuir</i> was
taken, and <i>Maelsechlainn Mac Raghnaill</i> slain. On this site was
found the largest quern in the Museum, R.I.A., the nether-stone
being twenty and three-quarter inches long by three and three-quarter
inches thick; the aperture for the pivot one and three-quarter
inches deep, the same across; it is surrounded by a raised
lip to retain in position the upper stone, which is nineteen and
a-half inches in diameter by two and three-quarter inches in
thickness: the grain aperture is three and a-half inches wide;
upon the upper surface is the mark of the cross-bar of the pivot,
its upper surface left in a rude state; it has one handle-hole.
The stone mould, figured <i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>, was found here, and a model
of a portion of the oak framework of the crannog&mdash;one-quarter
real size&mdash;was deposited in the Museum, R.I.A.</p>

<p><i>Lough Rinn</i> (<i>the lake of the promontory</i>) lies in the barony of
Mohill. It is mentioned in the <i>Annals of Loch Cé</i>, under date
1345, when O’Conor, “king” of Connaught, was killed by an
arrow at <i>Loch Airinn</i> whilst assisting <i>Mac Raghnaill</i>, to whom the
crannog on the lake belonged; for the sept of the Mac Rannals
formerly possessed the neighbouring district, then called <i>Conmaicue
Moyrein</i>. In the year 1847, the waters of Lough Rinn having
being lowered, two canoes were found imbedded in the mud near
an old castle at the promontory from whence the locality derives
its name; there was also a chain, or manacle, composed of iron
rods, looped at their ends, like one found in the Strokestown
crannogs. One of these canoes was a “single-piece,” hollowed
out of oak, and flat-bottomed, the length thirteen feet and the
breadth nearly two feet throughout; the sides were only four
inches high; but the original depth must have been greater. In
front of the old castle stands an island covered with self-sown
ash and thorn, and constructed with wooden piles, of slight
scantling, but perfectly sound; “the paling was interlaced and
pegged down in a very rude manner: the island appeared to have
been formed inside of it, and raised upon a similar description of
work.” A small bronze arrow and a spear-head were found two
feet deep in a gravel shoal close to Rinn Castle, between Loughs
Rinn and Sallagh.</p>

<p><i>St. John’s Lough</i> contained four crannogs, in which three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>silver coins of Edward I., II., and III. were found.</p>

<p><i>Loughtown</i> crannog measured one hundred and twenty feet
from east to west by one hundred feet from north to south, and
was surrounded by a mass of stakes upwards of fifteen feet wide,
inclining in towards the centre of the island.</p>

<p><i>Aghakilconnel Lough.</i>&mdash;Three iron pots, one of them triangular
in form, were found on this site.</p>

<p><i>Lough MacHugh</i> contained two crannogs; one measured
seventy-four feet by one hundred and eighteen feet.</p>

<p><i>Cloonbo</i> and <i>Cloonturk Loughs</i> had each two sites.</p>

<p><i>Cloonfinnan</i>, <i>Cloonboniagh</i>, <i>Castlefore</i>, and <i>Funshinagh Loughs</i>,
each contained a crannog.</p>

<p><i>Crannog Island.</i>&mdash;No account is given of this site.</p>

<p><i>Manorhamilton.</i>&mdash;A crannog, a canoe paddle, and other articles
were discovered not far from this village.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p><i>Muinter Eolius.</i>&mdash;A crannog in this district is mentioned in
the Irish Annals (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_152">152</a>).</p>

<h4>COUNTY SLIGO.</h4>

<p><i>Glencar</i> lake, situated between the counties of Sligo and Leitrim,
is embosomed in mountains; to the north lies the Ben-Bulben
range, and to the south the Castlegal range with bold precipitous
sides, its grey limestone cliffs resembling ancient weather-beaten
fortifications, and its slopes in parts clothed with plantations of
fir. The rain that falls on the summits of the Ben-Bulben range
descends to the vale in numerous streamlets, which, after a continuance
of wet weather, appear when viewed from a distance like
streaks of silver. Some form waterfalls of more or less magnitude,
of which one is called in Irish <i>Sruth-an-ail-an-ard</i>, or the
stream against the height; because in this instance, when the wind
blows from a certain point, the ordinary laws of hydrology seem to
be reversed, and the water, instead of falling, is either driven
upwards and back against the mountain, or it is blown outwards
in a sheet of spray, like a pennant. Ben-Bulben, or Ben-Gulban,
<i>Gulban’s Peak</i>, is said to be so named from Gulban, son of Nial
of the Nine Hostages, who was fostered near it. Gulban was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
ancestor of the O’Donnells, who, through this mountain gorge,
frequently poured their forces into Sligo. In the year 1595
O’Donnell, when pursued by Bingham, retired to this valley, in
full confidence that the wary Saxon would not attempt to follow
him through the narrow and difficult defile, and in 1597, the same
chief encamped in the immediate vicinity of the eastern crannog.
So late as 1609, in a curious old map of the county, the valley of
Glencar and the slopes of Ben-Bulben are delineated as covered
with wood, and the following quaintly-worded information is appended:&mdash;“Ye
high hills of Ben-Bulben, where yearly timbereth
a falcon esteemed the hardiest in Ireland.” The locality is still the
<i>habitat</i> of the peregrine falcon.</p>

<p>Although, in the present day, lovers of the picturesque resort
to Glencar, yet, probably, few are aware that the locality was
anciently the home of a considerable lacustrine population. In
the early part of this century, when the level of the lake had been
lowered by drainage operations, several crannogs became visible;
and the one situated at the eastern extremity, where the stream
enters the lake, had seemingly been the largest. Broken bones,
antlers of deer, a quantity of old timber, and some articles of
bronze (amongst them a tweezers) were said to have been obtained.
In the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>, under date 1541, this site
is noticed as the scene of strife between two branches of the
O’Rourkes.&mdash;“The eastern crannog, on the lake of <i>Glen Dallain</i>,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
was taken by the sons of Donal, son of Donogh O’Rourke, from
Donogh, the son of Donogh O’Rourke. In some time after, the
sons of Donogh O’Rourke, namely, Donal and Ferganainm, made
an attack on the crannog, and privately set fire to the fortress;
that act was perceived and detected, and they were pursued on the
lake and were overtaken by the sons of Donal; Ferganainm, the
son of Donogh, was slain, and drowned by them; and Donal
having been taken prisoner, was hanged by the sons of Donal, the
son of Donogh O’Rourke.” At the western end of the lake&mdash;on
the subsidence of the water after drainage&mdash;four crannogs became
visible; but, owing to the subsequent silting up of the cutting in
the bed of the Drumcliff river, they have all again disappe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>ared,
with the exception of the largest, which, at the time of the drainage,
was accessible from the land dryshod, though now the water
reaches to a wader’s knees. To the east of this crannog there
is still a considerable depth of water: the beach descends rapidly,
and layers of large beams, from six to seven inches in diameter,
can be seen radiating from a common centre; in some instances,
three or even four layers can be traced. Cross-beams are noticeable,
also piles driven in at intervals; these are only three or four
inches in diameter, and sharply pointed at the ends; this side of
the crannog presents the appearance of having been denuded of
stones. The height of the water prevents exploration; but it has
been roughly computed that, including the wooden substructure
now submerged, the diameter had formerly averaged seventy feet,
or possibly more. Careful search amongst the stones merely led
to the discovery of fractured bones of <i>Bos longifrons</i>, <i>Cervus elaphus</i>,
<i>Sus scrofa</i>, &amp;c., and numerous teeth of mammalia, together with a
fossil, possibly a selected specimen used as an ornament or charm,
and pronounced to be a <i>Zaphrentis</i>&mdash;a coral of the carboniferous
formation.</p>

<div class="verse">A worm of other class, to crawl began.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Opposite the crannog, the beach on the mainland is strewn
with fractured bones similar to those on the island. The antlers
of a <i>Cervus elaphus</i> were found close to the shore, and a wooden
peg (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_104">104</a>, <a href="#fig108">fig. 108</a>) was seen lying on the bottom near
a beam. In one of the mythical legends of the “Pursuit of
Diarmuid and Grainne,” mention is made of the Glencar lake-dwellings
as one of their places of refuge.</p>

<p><i>Lough Arrow.</i>&mdash;Not far from the old Abbey of Ballindoon is
an artificial island formed almost entirely of stones; the earth&mdash;in
which a few young firs are now growing&mdash;was brought to it by the
late proprietor, J. Gethin. This crannog, the largest of a group,
still stands well above the surface of the lake. To the north&mdash;but
separated from it by a deep and narrow channel&mdash;is a shoal called
“Sunken Island,” which is in summer weather almost dry, and
around both these sites were numerous fractured bones of the <i>Bos
longifrons</i>, <i>Cervus elaphus</i>, and <i>Sus scrofa</i>. Still further to the
north, and close to the shore of Ballindoon demesne, is pla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>inly
discernible the summit of a large pile of stones, evidently deposited
by human agency, but the depth of water effectually precluded
any hope of obtaining handicraft “finds.” The island at
<i>Annaghcloy Point</i> is said to be artificial, and around <i>Oilean-na-prechaun</i>
(<i>Crow Island</i>)&mdash;seemingly formed of small stones, and
situated near the exit of the river Unshin from Lough Arrow, at
Bellarush bridge&mdash;were found lying on the beach numerous fractured
bones of the usual crannog type.</p>

<p><i>Lochanacrannog</i> is the name of a small townland in the barony
of Tireragh, near the residence of Sir Malby Crofton, Bart. The
small pond in which the crannog is situated becomes almost dry
in summer, yet, despite this favourable circumstance, no relics have
been discovered. A trench cut through the island showed that it
was composed of clay mingled with some few stones, and these,
around the exterior edge, were arranged in a systematic manner.</p>

<p><i>Ballygawley.</i>&mdash;This lake, picturesquely situated at the foot of
the Slieve Dæane range of mountains, is embosomed in wood,
which may be viewed as now representing the primeval mantle
that had formerly covered the neighbouring slopes, when</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The crannog lies about one hundred and eighty yards from the
eastern shore, and the diameter of the area covered with stones is
eighty-five feet, but the wooden substructure extends to a considerable
distance under water. The beams, protruding from under
the superincumbent stones, appeared&mdash;as is usual&mdash;to radiate from
a common centre, but two beams on the west shore, and one that
was raised from a depth of one foot under the present water surface
on the south shore, seemed to lie at a tangent to the circle of
the crannog. In <a href="#fig238">fig. 238</a> the mortises <a href="#fig238"><i>a</i>, <i>b</i></a> secured the heads of
piles, and <a href="#fig238"><i>c</i>, <i>d</i></a> (of larger size) may have held some of the radial
beams. The highest point of the crannog now stands about five
feet above the level of the lake, which has been reduced three feet
in height, as the result of drainage operations carried out by the
proprietor, Colonel Cooper. Some of the encircling piles remain
in position; three were noticed on the north, and one on the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>-east
shore. To the west and south the water is shallow, and this
shoal would seem to have been the “kitchen midden,” or refuse
heap, for numerous teeth of the <i>Bos longifrons</i> were here dredged
up, and close to the encircling piles lay a quantity of fractured hazel
nuts and some pieces of charcoal. On the east and west there were,
in the fine sand on the crannog beach, small portions of calcined
bones, resembling those found in the cromlech interments at Carrowmore.
A. W. Foot, M.D., to whom they were submitted,
states that these fragments were “undoubtedly bone, several of
them unmistakably calcined (from carbonaceous residue). Some
of the fragments are entirely composed of carbonate of lime, others
are a mixture of carbonate and phosphate of lime. It could not
be determined whether they are animal or human; this should be
conjectured from surrounding or collateral circumstances.”</p>

<p><i>Lough Gill</i> is one of the numerous localities in Ireland to which
is attached the legend of a buried city. Amongst the peasantry
there long lingered a tradition that these waters had overspread
a plain whereon stood the ancient town of Sligo, the numerous
islands being supposed to represent former knolls on its green expanse.
As the result of recent extensive drainage operations in
the county Leitrim, a large additional amount of water has,
through the river Bonnett, been directed into Lough Gill at its
eastern extremity. The consequent greatly increased height of
surface would, of itself, present an insuperable bar to exploration,
so that no means remain of ascertaining if an extensive lacustrine
settlement had ever really existed here of old. Within the actual
bounds of the lake, which is seven miles in length, the islands,
highly picturesque, and of some extent&mdash;one of them contains
twenty-five acres&mdash;are of undoubted natural formation; there is,
however, near the site of the ancient Castle of Annagh&mdash;noticed
in the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>, under date 1533&mdash;one small
islet, bearing a crannog-like appearance, but, as far as can now be
ascertained, no traces of occupation have been found around it.
The short stretch of the Garvogue, or Sligo river, which forms the
outlet from the lake to the sea, seems to present the peculiar features
characteristic of sites the most favoured by a lacustrine population,
viz., good fishing-ground, and wide borders of marsh on
the adjoining mainland. The ancient name of the demesne of
Hazlewood was Annagh (<i>a swamp</i>), and a portion of the grounds
which skirt the river, and now remarkable for its pecul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>iarly ornamental
planting, was so late as sixty years since a mere spongy
bog, on which no firm footing was obtainable. The opposite shore,
called Cleveragh, was of still softer and more watery nature, and
its name implies that either hurdles or rude wicker-work bridges
had been formerly used for crossing the river or the marshy spots
near it.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Along this side, and but a short distance from the shore,
there were, at varying intervals of space from each other, three
shoals, about the size of ordinary crannogs, and nearly circular in
form. They were occasionally so little perceptible as to prove an
obstruction for boats, and in the early part of this century the
proprietor, after surrounding each shoal with a low wall of masonry,
caused a sufficient quantity of soil to be conveyed to them
for the growth of a few trees. At that period nothing was known
respecting former lacustrine populations in any part of Europe, so
that no special examination was made of the nature of the shoals
in question. In the present day, however, with the aid of the
light thrown upon the construction of lake dwellings by modern
discoveries, the position and aspect of the three islets becomes
striking, and cannot fail to call to the mind of an observer the old
tradition of a “buried city” in Lough Gill.</p>

<p>The number of lacustrine sites in each county in Ireland is
marked within a small circle on the map (<a href="#plate50">plate <span class="smcapuc">L.</span></a>), and the
lake dwelling area, as at present known, is shown by a shading,
light or dark, according to the number of sites. The province of
Ulster (including historical notices of crannogs) contains one
hundred and twenty-four; Leinster, nineteen; Munster, nine;
and Connaught, sixty-nine. This makes for all Ireland a total of
two hundred and twenty-one. The ascertained sites are, however,
in all probability, but a mere fraction of the multitude that
had formerly existed. Further explorations amongst the remains
of Irish and Scottish lake dwellings would, doubtless, tend to
strengthen the evidence of these structures having been the work
of a people who, at that remote period, formed most probably a
homogeneous community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>In the opinion of some theorists, these dwellings seem characteristic
of an early wave of immigration from the East&mdash;then
throwing off its superabundant population as does now the West&mdash;and
in this manner it is supposed that the lakes of Central Europe
and Great Britain became studded with water-laved homes. However,
as before stated, they, with a greater degree of probability,
sprang up independently by reason of the natural laws which
govern man’s actions in a semi-civilized state&mdash;in Erin, their first
founders being rude flint-armed hunters of the <i>Megaceros</i>, the bear,
the wolf, and their descendants wielders of the pike and matchlock.
Recent investigation traces “island homes” back to a period so
remote, that the evidences of man’s formation and occupation of
these retreats prove in their way as interesting as the remains of
the buried cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, for lacustrine dwellings,
also, show traces of a species of civilization long passed away
(evidences of which were observable on the sites of Venice, Mexico,
and London), and the purposes of their primitive founders were
alike, whether situated on the lagoons of the Adriatic, the flats of
Central America, or the reaches of the Thames.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_148_148" id="Footnote_148_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_148_148"><span class="label">[148]</span></a> Sir Denham Jephson Norreys, in a Paper contributed to the R. Hist, and Arch.
Asso. Ireland (<i>Journal</i>, vol. iv., pp. 278-79), thus explains the original process of
riveting:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“1st. Prepare a wooden core, or mandril, of the size and form of the inside of the
trumpet.
</p>
<p>
“2ndly. Place the strap of bronze to hold the rivets in the centre of its inner
surface.
</p>
<p>
“3rdly. Cut the plate of bronze which is to form the trumpet to such a size that,
when folded on the core, the edges may meet accurately on the centre of the bronze
strap: hold all together by solder, or by any other means&mdash;perhaps coils of wire may
have been used.
</p>
<p>
“4thly. Drill the holes for the rivets, countersinking them on the outside. See
Plate <span class="smcapuc">XXIX.</span>, fig. 1.
</p>
<p>
“5thly. Remove the wooden core.
</p>
<p>
“6thly. By means of a cleft stick (or other contrivance) insert the rivets from the
inside, outwards.
</p>
<p>
“7thly. As each rivet passes through to the surface it is to be drawn up as tightly
as possible; the shank is to be bent back, or held up by any other means, so that the
head of the rivet shall not be allowed to fall.
</p>
<p>
“8thly. Having inserted all the rivets, insert a metal core, or mandril, fitting the
interior with great exactness.
</p>
<p>
“9thly. Complete the riveting from the outside, the metal core preventing the
rivet-heads from being disturbed, and allowing the countersunk portion of the hole to
be securely filled by a portion of the shank.
</p>
<p>
“10thly. Remove the metal core. The trumpet is now ready to be burnished off.
</p>
<p>
“After writing the above, it occurred to me that I had neglected to inquire how
the inner strap was to be held in its place for the insertion of the rivets. Ordinary
solder could not have been used, as none appears between the strap and the plates. It
might, perhaps, have been effected by a slow removal of the wooden core, and by the
insertion, from the smaller end of temporary rivets or fastenings, as the core was
being pushed forward; by such means at least half of the length of the strap could
be firmly held in its place.”</p></div>

states that Joyce in his <i>Irish Names of Places</i> translates the name of the Fermanagh
town of Lisbellaw, <i>Lis-bel-atha, the lis of the ford mouth</i>. Now, there was no river
ever there, consequently there could be no “ford mouth.” There is certainly a <i>lis</i>
or ford in the neighbourhood, but the little stream which now drives the woollen mill
of Lisbellaw flows through a deep cutting communicating with Loch Eyes, and which
was made only in recent times. The <i>natural</i> outlet from the loch ran, and still runs,
in a northerly direction, and cannot have influenced the naming of Lisbellaw, as its
course commences at a distance of some miles from the village. “The name Lisbellaw
seems to invite investigation. Could it be translated ‘the fort or lis of Balhu,’
even as Dunleary is ‘the fort or dun of Laighaire’”?</p></div>

to Neavin and Nevin. This family was originally settled at Crannog-Meg-Cnaimhain,
now Crannagh-Mac-Nevin, in the south-east extremity of the parish of Tynagh, barony
of Leitrim, county Galway, and the name is still general in that and the adjoining
barony of Loughrea. The first notice of this family to be found in Irish history occurs
in the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>, at the year 1159, where it is recorded that
“Athius Mac Nevin was slain at Ardee.” The crannog is mentioned in an inquisition
taken at Galway on the 10th of October, 1605:&mdash;“Quod Hugo Mac Knavin, alius dictus

“Solinus relates that the Irish formed the handles of their swords from the teeth
of large sea-monsters which they polished to a most beautiful whiteness.” “That the
handles were very much smaller than those of modern swords with guards, and used
for cutting as well as thrusting, there can be no doubt, yet some of them are large
enough to receive a moderate-sized hand. Without discussing the generally received
opinion that the men who used such swords had very small hands&mdash;like some of the
Asiatics of the present day&mdash;the mode of using these weapons must not be forgotten.
They were employed for stabbing and fencing, in which the middle, ring, and little
fingers alone grasped the handle completely, while the thumb and fore-finger passed
upwards on each side of the blade, fitting into the curved hollows of the hilt&mdash;and not like
the method of the cavalry soldier of the present day, who, when about to deal a heavy
blow, grasps his weapon with the closed hand, which must occupy a space of about four

crannog kind, in a perfect state. A brooch, or fibula, composed of iron, bronze, and a
white metal&mdash;perhaps silver; it had evidently been prepared for enamel&mdash;the pin was
eaten away by corrosion. An iron knife, with bronze mounting to the handle, which
was pierced for rivets. An ordinary crannog knife-blade, like those found in Anglo-Saxon
interments. Portion of a small iron shoe for horse or ass. Piece of an iron
band. A thin bronze fillet that might have been used for securing the staves of a
small wooden vessel, or intended for a hair-band: a lady who tried it on, pronounced
it to be decidedly an article of feminine adornment&mdash;let that decide the point! A
small article of late bronze, apparently belonging to horse trappings. A whetstone.
A worked stone or disc. A lump of iron dross or “slag.” The under stone of a quern.
From time to time no fewer than three single-piece canoes have been discovered beneath
the waters of the lough; one was for years used as a trough for cattle, and afterwards
cut up for firewood; the others were utilized in the roofs of out-offices.&mdash;<i>Journal Royal

deer’s horn, four of them curiously fashioned (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>). Several fragments of
quern-stones; it was stated by the older inhabitants of the surrounding district that
many years previously the entire surface of the island was covered with querns in a
more or less perfect condition; two of those obtained (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_89">89</a>) were inscribed with
a cross-like ornamentation. Four whetstones of the usual four-sided crannog type;
they vary in size from six inches to four inches in length. Portions of rims of vessels
of fictile ware (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_98">98</a>); a large fragment had been discovered on the island some
time previously. There were also articles both of bronze and iron, but so greatly fractured
and corroded that their character could not well be defined. When excavating
near the centre of the island, at a distance of about two and a-half feet from the surface,
a large stone was found with a punched cross-like pattern upon one of its sides
(<a href="#plate42">plate <span class="smcapuc">XLII.</span>, No. 6</a>). Bones of animals, principally of the cow, goat, sheep, and pig,
were found in such immense numbers, that the crannog became known as “Bone
Island.”</p></div>

but the exact localities not mentioned:&mdash;Three bronze celts, with loops on their side&mdash;in
one instance traces of the handle still remained; a bronze dagger, twelve inches in
length; two double-pointed bronze arrow-heads; a bronze gouge or chisel; the head
of a bronze hunting-spear; part of a bronze sword; a bronze cap, seemingly the termination
of the butt of some weapon; the bronze handle of a javelin or spear, with loop
attached; the boss of a shield of bronze; a bronze knife, with traces of gilding; two
bronze daggers, the one ten and a-half inches, the other seven inches in length; several
bronze rings of different sizes, two of them with transverse spring openings, others
hollow, being probably parts of armour or horse-trappings; two bronze needles; a

ornamented, and two were of large size and common type; parts of bronze fibulae;
fragments of several bronze instruments and numerous rivets; a small circular bell and

The following articles, discovered in the large crannog, were presented to the Museum,
R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A.:&mdash;The upper stone of a grain-rubber; a perfect quern, seventeen inches
in diameter, its upper surface highly decorated; a flat circular stone disc or quoit, like
some found in connexion with cinerary urns; three do., one-half inch thick, and three
and a-quarter inches in diameter; a portion of the stone coulter of a plough, thirteen
inches long, with an artificial hole near the broad end for attaching it to the beam; a
mortar, eight inches high, by seventeen and a-half inches wide, decorated at the corners
with grotesque figures; a stone mould, with the casting groove in the long axis; two
weapon-sharpeners of a remarkably hard stone resembling quartz; eleven fragments of
sharpening-stones, averaging from two and a-half inches to six inches in length, two
of them perforated; a four-sided whetstone, twenty inches by three inches; a large
oval stone, artificially smoothed on all its surfaces&mdash;like a web-polisher&mdash;it measures
ten and a-half inches, by three and a-half inches; several smaller-sized do.; a curved,
water-worn, dark-coloured stone, highly polished, probably a burnisher; a flat red
touchstone, three and a-half inches long, formed of jasper, and used for testing gold; a
portion of slate with three circular cavities; a stone half perforated; a small perforated
stone like a “whorl”; five globular stones like sink-stones for nets; a stone bullet,
three inches in diameter; three oval-shaped, artificially worked stones; a bone spoon
(p. <a href="#Page_140">140</a>, <a href="#fig194">fig. 194</a>); four portions of combs; two large beads; a ferrule, solid at one end,
and two and a-half inches long; a small, highly-polished pin, and a very perfect piercer
of bone; two horns of red deer, both imperfect; ten large boar-tusks, and some teeth
of ruminants; a ring of bronze, that had been probably part of a fibula&mdash;it was in an
imperfect state; a ring, three and a-quarter inches in diameter; a large decorated bronze
pin, seven and a-half inches long, and a smaller one that measured three inches; the
head of a battle-axe of iron; a knife-blade, with perforated haft, eight and a-half
inches, and a smaller blade, two and three-quarter inches in length; a globular piece
of iron, two and three-quarter inches in diameter; the head of a small hammer; three
fragments of rings, and eleven other fragments of iron, the former uses of which could
not be determined; several pieces of slag; fourteen pieces of broken pottery&mdash;amongst
them was part of a bowl or urn, unglazed, decorated on the outside with deeply-grooved
lines, and with slight indentations on the inverted lip&mdash;it was formed of very dark-coloured
clay, mixed with particles of white quartz or felspar; four small earthen
crucibles of the usual shape, three of them very small; a pipe-clay vessel, manifestly
intended for refining purposes; the bowls of two small pipes, commonly, but erroneously,
denominated “Danish tobacco-pipes”; a flat, highly-coloured bead of amber,
and a larger one of irregular shape; a small bead of enamel paste, showing a mixture
of the colours red, yellow, and blue; also fragments of Kimmage coal-rings; parts of a
bracelet, which seems to have been pointed at one end. Great numbers of hazel nuts
were found throughout the crannog, and there was a barrel-shaped piece of wood, three
and a-quarter inches long, hollow, and perforated with six holes; it had been used
either in weaving, or as a net float.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_220_220" id="Footnote_220_220"></a><a href="#FNanchor_220_220"><span class="label">[220]</span></a> In addition to the usual collection of bones, the articles obtained from the crannog
were as follows:&mdash;A large stone, hollowed in its upper surface, used evidently for crushing
corn, the rock forming this crusher, being coarse basalt, is foreign to the district;
it appears to be portion of a block of columnar basalt, brought to the spot probably from
the N. E. of Ireland. There was another large stone of a carboniferous grit foreign to
the locality, evidently the upper stone of a grain-rubber; it was slightly convex on one
side, and had an artificially-polished surface. Two round stones&mdash;the one of quartz,
the other of carboniferous grit. Three pieces of spoon-shaped flint. A stone ring,
made from the ordinary greywacke shale of the district; it was too small for the finger.
Part of another ring, somewhat larger in size. A bead of glass, and one of amber.
Portion of a jet bracelet. Some articles of brass, comparatively modern. Fragments of
pottery (undescribed). A crucible. An article formed of baked clay, two inches in length
by one in breadth, having one of its surfaces convex, and the other concave; it bore
the mark of a cross near one of its extremities. Several pieces of iron ore; and a
bronze axe that was discovered in 1843 on the shores of the lake in the immediate vicinity
of the crannog.</p></div>

The following are a few of the articles found on this site, and nearly all are now
in Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A.:&mdash;Two double-edged swords of iron. A curved blade. A peculiar

manacle (<a href="#plate08">plate <span class="smcapuc">VIII.</span></a>, p. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>). Two spear-heads in fine preservation (p. <a href="#Page_63">63</a>). An axe-head
(p. <a href="#Page_68">68</a>). A bowl and a ladle (p. <a href="#Page_85">85</a>). A small single-edged knife. An iron pipe,
with hook attached. A bronze object of unknown use (p. <a href="#Page_143">143</a>). Three armillæ of rude
fashion; one of them formed of a thin plate measuring rather more than half an inch
in diameter; the extremities slightly recurved. An ornament of mixed metal, and an
enamelled plate of iron (p. <a href="#Page_138">138</a>). Portions of a small ring fibula, with cavities in the
metal in which enamel appears to have been encrusted. Numerous bronze pins of various
sizes and fashion. A skean or dagger (p. <a href="#Page_65">65</a>). A thin triangular blade, corroded
at edges; the lower portion prolonged into a tang; the bevel on the edge, continued
round the flat handle-plate, shows that the article was cast and not subsequently hammered
out. A very rude piece of bronze somewhat resembling a broad arrow. A sling
stone of quartz rock. An oblong or natural kidney-shaped stone, five inches long, and
rounded at the extremities. Several whetstones. Two bone needles or bodkins, perforated
at the extremity. A double-toothed comb, rudely ornamented with lines and
concentric circles; and other combs, or fragments of same, one of them being a small
perfect specimen, four inches long. A horn tine, polished at top. A very small four-sided
drinking vessel of horn, two and a-half inches high. A polished leg-bone of a
deer, curiously carved. A wooden spike, broad in the middle, and sharpened at each
end; it is supposed to belong to the weapon class. There were also amber, jet, glass,
and enamelled beads, now in the Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A.</p></div>

naked human figure. A sandstone ring. Several whetstones. A dark-coloured
piece of shale and sandstone, three inches across, marked on the surface like the “game
stones” in the Museum, R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A. A mould, formed of agalmatolite or potstone; on one
side it had a circular cast for a harness stud. A decorated bone comb, and portions of
eight others. Many curious bone pins (described <i>ante</i> “Articles of the Toilet,” &amp;c.). A
spatula-shaped bone (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_140">140</a>). Flat pieces of ornamental bone (p. <a href="#Page_139">139</a>). A bone
knife or skean, highly decorated on the handle and along a portion of the blade. A
knife and fork of bone, colour dark brown; the handles are square, and decorated with
the domino pattern. Several miscellaneous bone articles, consisting of pins, handles,
knives, &amp;c. Bronze tweezers, and several ornamented bronze pins. An admirably-designed
brooch, or brooch-pin, of <i>findruin</i> or white bronze; its ring, two inches in
diameter, was a mass of spiral ornamentation, pointing to an extremely early age. A
very perfect short-bladed bolt-head, with narrow loops. A narrow dagger-blade, with
high mid-rib and ridge on handle-plate. Amongst the iron remains there occurred,
swords, varying in length from six to eighteen inches, axe-heads, spear-heads, shears,
bodkins, and many small articles of domestic use.</p></div>

amongst the miscellaneous bone articles Nos. 1 to 4, and 18, are bone hafts or handles,
one of them stained black, and ornamented by spiral and interrupted grooves. There
are two horn tines, artificially shaped, and No. 40 is a shank-bone of a sheep or goat,
stained black, highly polished, and perforated at one end. Besides the celebrated
bronze shield described (<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_71">71</a>), the following antiquities are recorded as having
been discovered in this site:&mdash;“A long, narrow, spear-head of bronze, in excellent preservation,
the socket&mdash;circular in form&mdash;measuring nearly twenty-three inches in
length, and two one-eighth inches in breadth at base of blade, along which there is a
ridge with a feather edge running into flat compressed loops at the junction of blade
and socket. A bronze spear-head, slightly defective in socket, but blade perfect; it
was found with a portion of the charred handle remaining in it. A very small dagger-blade
of bronze, with wide notches in the handle-plate. A bronze tube, probably the
ferrule-end of a spear, and having a rivet-hole.”&mdash;<i>Cat. Mus., R.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;A.</i>, pp. 487, 507-517.</p></div>
